  summary: 'how every name in the API is formed, so you can guess one you have not seen',
  body: `
Every name in the API follows these rules, so once you know one part of it you can guess the
rest. The spec's own tests check the ones a machine can.

## Shape

- Functions, methods, fields, events and option keys are \`snake_case\`: \`play_animation\`,
  \`hit_position\`. Types are \`PascalCase\`: \`Centity\`, \`Vec3\`, \`ClickEvent\`.
- Namespaces are called with a dot, handles with a colon: \`nf.players.get(...)\`,
  \`player:send_message(...)\`.
- Words are spelled out: \`position\`, not \`pos\`; \`direction\`, not \`dir\`; \`arguments\`, not
  \`args\`.
- Units are in the docs, not the names. Rotations are degrees, durations are ticks (20 a
  second), distances are blocks, unless a page says otherwise.

## Getters, setters and questions

- A getter is a noun, with no \`get_\`: \`name()\`, \`position()\`, \`health()\`. It returns **one
  value**, \`nil\` when there's nothing to say (\`translation()\` is a \`Vec3?\`). The one
  exception is \`Vec3:unpack()\`.
- A setter is \`set_\` and the getter's noun, and takes one value: \`health()\` and
  \`set_health(n)\`. Values that change together are one table:
  \`set_brightness({ block_light = 15, sky_light = 15 })\`.
- A keyed getter or setter takes the key first: \`game_rule(rule)\` and
  \`set_game_rule(rule, value)\`, \`item(index)\` and \`set_item(index, item)\`.
- A yes-or-no getter is \`is_<adjective>()\`, \`has_<noun>()\` or \`can_<verb>()\`, and its setter
  drops the prefix: \`is_visible()\` and \`set_visible(b)\`, \`has_gravity()\` and
  \`set_gravity(b)\`, \`can_fly()\` and \`set_can_fly(b)\`. The one exception is \`exists()\`.
- A list is a plural noun and returns an array: \`players()\`, \`nodes()\`, \`viewers()\`.
- A yes-or-no field of a plain table is a bare adjective: \`event.cancelled\`,
  \`event.in_menu\`, \`event.first_join\`.

## What a thing is

| Name | Means |
| --- | --- |
| \`id()\` | The handle's own identity: the string to store to get the same handle back later. A centity instance's id, a player's or entity's UUID, a dialog's id. |
| \`exists()\` | Whether the thing is there now: a centity still in the world, an entity alive and loaded, a player online, a menu window open, a file on disk. |
| \`kind()\` | The id of what it's an instance of: the centity's folder (\`"crate"\`), \`"minecraft:zombie"\`, \`"minecraft:stone"\`. An item table's \`kind\` field is the same. |
| \`name()\` | What a person reads: a player's name, a node's name, a file's name. |

A handle to something that has gone (a player who left, a removed centity) answers \`nil\` or
\`false\` rather than erroring; a mistake (an unknown event, centity or animation, a wrong
argument type) is an error at your script's line.

## One verb per idea

| Verb | Means | For example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`run\` | run a command line | \`player:run(command)\`, \`nf.server.run(command)\` |
| \`send_<thing>\` | show text to one player | \`send_message\`, \`send_actionbar\`, \`send_title\` |
| \`broadcast\` | show text to everyone online and the console | \`nf.server.broadcast(text)\` |
| \`open_<screen>\`, \`close_<screen>\` | put a screen in front of a player, or take it away | \`player:open_menu\`, \`player:open_dialog\`, \`dialog:open_for(player)\` |
| \`spawn\`, \`spawn_<thing>\` | make something in the world | \`nf.centities.spawn\`, \`world:spawn_entity\`, \`world:spawn_particle\` |
| \`create\` | make something a script owns that isn't in the world | \`nf.bossbars.create\`, \`nf.menus.create\`, \`nf.dialogs.create\` |
| \`remove\` | take something out of the world or the game | \`centity:remove()\`, \`entity:remove()\`, \`bossbar:remove()\` |
| \`delete\` | erase stored data | \`file:delete()\` |
| \`cancel\` | stop something pending, or what an event is about | \`task:cancel()\`, \`subscription:cancel()\`, \`event:cancel()\` |
| \`clear\` | empty a container or a display | \`menu:clear()\`, \`inventory:clear()\`, \`player:clear_title()\` |
| \`play_<thing>\`, \`stop_<thing>\` | start or stop something playing | \`play_animation\`, \`play_sound\`, \`stop_sound\` |
| \`add_<thing>\`, \`remove_<thing>\`, \`has_<thing>\` | what's in a collection | tags, effects, passengers, items |
| \`apply_<thing>\` | push a physics body | \`apply_impulse\`, \`apply_force\` |
| \`get(key)\`, \`all(filter?)\` | look one thing up, or list them, in a namespace | \`nf.players.get\`, \`nf.centities.all({ kind = "crate" })\` |
| \`on\`, \`once\`, \`emit\` | events | every class with events |
| \`teleport\` | move a whole thing somewhere | centities, entities, players |
| \`look_at\` | turn to face a point in the world | nodes, centities, entities, players |

## Positions and facing

- \`position()\` is a \`Vec3\` in world space, \`location()\` a [Location](location.md) (a world,
  a position and which way it faces), \`world()\` a [World](world.md).
- A name says its space only when the thing's own space isn't the world's: a node's own
  transform is \`translation()\` (in its parent's space), so where it is in the world is
  \`world_position()\`. See [Coordinate spaces](spaces.md).
- Facing is \`yaw()\`, \`pitch()\` and \`direction()\` (a unit \`Vec3\`), with \`set_yaw\`,
  \`set_pitch\` and \`look_at(point)\`.

## Events

- A server-wide event on \`nf.on\` is \`<subject>_<verb>\`: \`player_join\`, \`block_break\`,
  \`menu_click\`. An event on a handle is a bare verb: \`click\`, \`press\`, \`open\`, \`tick\`,
  \`animation_end\`. A custom event has a \`:\` in its name: \`"shop:purchased"\`.
- Every handler gets a table whose type is named \`<Something>Event\`.
- A field name means the same in every payload: \`click\` is the kind of click, \`target\` what
  was hit, \`key\` a dialog button's key. See [Events](events.md).

## Option tables

- Optional parameters past one or two go in a last \`options\` table:
  \`this:play_animation("open", { speed = 2 })\`.
- Option tables are strict: a key that isn't one of the table's is an error, as it is in an
  item table.

const spaces: Article = {
  file: 'spaces.md',
  title: 'Coordinate spaces',
  summary: 'which space each position is in, and how to convert between them',
  body: `
Every position, offset, direction and velocity is a [Vec3](vec3.md), and every function that
takes or returns one says which space it's in. There are three:

| Space | Origin and axes | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **world** | the world's | players, entities, blocks, particles, sounds, raycasts, and every physics velocity, impulse and force |
| **centity** | the centity's anchor (\`centity:position()\`), turned by its yaw | its root nodes' translations |
| **parent** | the node's parent node | a node's \`translation()\`, \`rotation()\` and \`scale()\` |

A root node's parent space is the centity's space; any other node's is its parent node's own
space. Rotations are Euler angles in degrees.

## Converting

| From | To | Call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| world | centity | \`centity:to_local(point)\` |
| centity | world | \`centity:to_world(point)\` |
| world | a node's own space (where its children sit) | \`node:to_local(point)\` |
| a node's own space | world | \`node:to_world(point)\` |
| a direction in a node's own space | world | \`node:world_direction(direction)\` (rotation only) |

\`node:world_position()\` and \`node:world_rotation()\` say where a node is in the world as it's
shown now, animation and physics included.

\`\`\`lua
-- the top centre of a crate, wherever it has rolled to
local crate = assert(this:node("crate"))
local top = crate:to_world(vec3(0.5, 1, 0.5))
if top then
  crate:apply_impulse_at(vec3(0, 0, 4), top)
end
\`\`\`

## Physics is in world space

Velocities, impulses, forces and the point an impulse is applied at are all world space, so
what a click reports goes straight back in: \`node:apply_impulse_at(impulse, event.hit_position)\`.

## A centity's yaw

A centity turns about the vertical only: \`centity:yaw()\`, \`centity:set_yaw(degrees)\` and
\`centity:look_at(point)\`, and \`nf.centities.spawn(kind, location)\` uses the location's yaw.
The yaw turns the centity's space, so its root nodes, hitboxes and physics turn with it. For
pitch or roll, rotate a root node.

const packages: Article = {
  file: 'packages.md',
  title: 'Names across packages',
  summary:
    "how a script names its own package's things and the packages' it depends on, and how names read back",
  body: `
A project can depend on packages (\`netherforge.json\`'s \`dependencies\`, see the
[packages format](../format/packages.md)), which run on the same server beside it. Every
script belongs to one package: the project's own, or the package its file is in.

## Naming things

A name a script hands the API means what it would in one of its own package's files:

- **Bare** (\`"ruby"\`, \`"ui/coin"\`, \`require("util")\`): its own package's.
- **\`namespace:name\`** (\`"library:gem"\`, \`"<glyph:library:gems/gem>"\`,
  \`require("library:greetings")\`): a package its package depends on, which must export it
  (its \`netherforge.json\`'s \`exports\`). Anything else is an error naming the package:
  \`package "library" doesn't export its item "secret", so only it can use it\`.

That holds for every name: items, menus, dialogs, centities, particle effects, recipes, loot tables, resource pack
glyphs, skins, sounds and item models, modules, and the \`<glyph:…>\` tags in [Text](index.md#types).
A package's code calling another package's function is still that package's code: the library's
\`nf.items.create("gem")\` makes the library's gem whoever called it.

An \`Item\` table is a value, not a use: any script may hold, read, compare and hand back any
stack, whatever package's item or look it carries, as long as that's there. Making a stack from
an item's definition (\`nf.items.create\`) is a use, and needs the export.

## Names read back

A name the API hands a script is written as that script's package writes it: bare for its own,
\`namespace:name\` for another's. The library's gem is \`"gem"\` to the library's scripts and
\`"library:gem"\` to the project's; the project's ruby is \`"ruby"\` to the project and
\`"shop:ruby"\` to the library (with \`shop\` the project's namespace). That's every name read
back: \`stack.item\`, \`nf.items.id\`, \`item:id()\`, \`centity:kind()\`, \`menu:id()\`, glyph tags in
text, and an event's fields, which each package's handlers read in their own words.

An \`Item\` table keeps the words it was handed out in: one the project read, passed to a
library function, still says \`"ruby"\`. The API reads it in those words whichever package's
code hands it back, so \`nf.items.id(stack)\` in the library answers \`"shop:ruby"\`. Compare
stacks a caller handed you through \`nf.items.id\`, not \`stack.item\`. A plain string has no
such memory: a function taking a name from another package's code should be handed it in full
(\`"shop:ruby"\`).

## One edge: tail calls

A handle method (\`player:open_menu(...)\`, \`menu:set_skin(...)\`) knows whose code called it
from the innermost script function on the stack. A Lua tail call (\`return player:open_menu("shop")\`)
replaces the calling function's frame, and Lua keeps no record of which function that was, so
the method sees the function that called *that* one: when a library function ends in such a
tail call and the project called it, bare names in the call resolve in the project. Write
\`local menu = player:open_menu("shop") return menu\` in a function another package calls,
or name things in full. \`nf.*\` functions don't have this edge: each script's \`nf\` knows whose
it is.
