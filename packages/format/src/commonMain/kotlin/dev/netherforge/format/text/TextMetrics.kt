/**
 * How Minecraft lays out MiniMessage text, in font pixels (1/40 of a block for
 * a text display).
 *
 * Glyph widths come from the player's own client (the default font's bitmaps,
 * read by the editor when it imports a version), passed in as [advance]. So
 * this only runs where client data exists: the editor's previews and its
 * "fit to display" for text hitboxes. The plugin never measures text with it.
 *
 * Why there are two measurers: this one and [TextWidth] answer different
 * questions and must disagree where they do. This is a layout for drawing a
 * preview: it always has an answer (a character the font doesn't cover gets
 * an estimate, a glyph no pack has draws nothing, as the game draws it), it
 * wraps, and every line keeps its range of the source, all over the same
 * [MiniMessagePass] pieces the editor draws. [TextWidth] is the server's
 * `nf.text.width`: one number that's exact or null, never an estimate, so
 * anything it can't know (an uncovered character, an unknown glyph advance, a
 * client-only insert, another font) makes it null, and it reads unknown tags
 * as MiniMessage does (as text). Folding one into the other would make the
 * server guess or the preview go blank.
