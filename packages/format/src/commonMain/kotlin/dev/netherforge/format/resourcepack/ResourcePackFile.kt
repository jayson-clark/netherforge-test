 *
 * The folder name **is** the pack's Minecraft asset namespace, so `ui:forest`
 * in a menu is literally the key the client resolves; there is no
 * mapping table anywhere. Textures are PNGs under `resource_packs/<namespace>/textures/`
 * and are referenced by their path below that folder (`gui/forest.png`).
 *
 * Sounds are `.ogg` files under `resource_packs/<namespace>/sounds/`: each one is the
 * sound event `<namespace>:<path without .ogg>`, with nothing to declare.
 * [sounds] only refines events (variants, volume, pitch, a subtitle).
 *
 * The kinds are keyed objects: every reference is `<pack>:<key>`.
