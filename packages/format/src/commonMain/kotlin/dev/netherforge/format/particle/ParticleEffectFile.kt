/**
 * `particles/<id>/effect.json`: a timeline of particle spawns, played at a
 * place by scripts.
 *
 * An effect is data only: no script, nothing else in its folder. Its
 * [emitters] are keyed by name, so names are unique by construction and two
 * branches that each add one merge cleanly. They run in key order, which only
 * matters for which spawns survive the server's per-tick budget.
 *
 * Minecraft particles are fire-and-forget: the client owns their lifetime,
 * gravity and fade, so nothing here changes a particle once it's spawned.
 * "Over time" means [Curves] across successive spawns. The timing and
 * placement maths are [EffectSampler]'s, shared by the server and the
 * editor's preview.
