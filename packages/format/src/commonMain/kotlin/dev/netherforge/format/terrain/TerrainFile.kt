/**
 * `terrain/<id>.json`: how the terrain of a world the project makes is
 * generated. Nothing in it is a script: the same data is run by the server
 * ([TerrainGenerator]) and by the editor's live preview, from the same
 * code, so the preview is what the world will be (for a seed).
 *
 * A column of the world is shaped in order: the **terrain** (a height from
 * noise) is filled with **stone**, topped by **layers** from the surface
 * down and, below sea level, the sea; **caves** are carved out of it, the
 * **floor** (bedrock) is laid at the bottom, **ores** are scattered through
 * what's left, and **decorations** (single blocks and the project's
 * structures) are scattered on and in it. **Biomes** are chosen from two
 * climate noises (their borders jittered by a third) and give each place a
 * vanilla biome (its sky, grass and mobs) and, if they like, their own layers
 * and terrain, blended into their neighbours' near a border.
 *
 * Everything depends on the world's seed and its blocks' positions alone, never
 * on the order chunks are generated in, so a chunk comes out the same however
 * the world is explored.
