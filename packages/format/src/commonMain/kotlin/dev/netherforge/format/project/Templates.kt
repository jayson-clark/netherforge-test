        |
        |A NetherForge project: Minecraft server content (centities, Lua modules,
        |menus, dialogs, resource packs) as plain files, run by the NetherForge
        |plugin on a Paper server. `netherforge.json` names the target Minecraft version.
        |
        |## Before you change anything
        |
        |Read `$AGENT_DOCS/README.md`. The NetherForge editor writes it when it opens
        |the project, with the file format, the Lua API and the guides for the exact
        |version in use. Trust it over anything you remember or find online. If
        |`.netherforge/` is missing, ask for the project to be opened in the NetherForge
        |editor once.
        |
        |## Rules
        |
        |- Read the format page for a kind of file (`$AGENT_DOCS/format/<kind>.md`)
        |  before changing one. Every JSON file's `${'$'}schema` points at its JSON Schema.
        |- Use only the Lua API declared in `$LUALS_LIBRARY/nf.lua`. Scripts run in a
        |  sandbox without `io`, `os`, `package`, `load` or `debug`.
        |- Lua never goes inside JSON: scripts are `.lua` files next to the JSON that
        |  names them.
        |- Ids are folder names: lowercase letters, digits and `_`.
        |- Never edit `.netherforge/`: it's generated and not committed.
        |
        |## Check your work
        |
        |- `node $CLI_FILE check` validates the whole project as the editor does and
        |  prints `file:line: severity: message (at ${'$'}.json.path)`. Finish with no errors.
        |- `node $CLI_FILE format` rewrites project JSON in canonical form, so diffs
        |  stay small.
        |- `node $CLI_FILE test` runs the project's script tests (`*_test.lua`, written
        |  with `nf.test`: see `$AGENT_DOCS/guide/testing.md`) on a fake server and
        |  prints each test's verdict and the line it failed at. Add one for logic you
        |  write, and finish with every test passing.
        |- `node $CLI_FILE preview terrain/<id>.json --seed 42 --out map.png` draws a
        |  terrain as the editor's preview does (`--slice x --at 0` for the
        |  ground through a line), so you can look at terrain you changed. See
        |  `$AGENT_DOCS/guide/world-generation.md`.
        |- With the NetherForge editor open, its `netherforge` MCP server (`.mcp.json`)
        |  has tools for the rest: `get_problems` after editing, `reload` and then
        |  `get_console` to see a change run on the dev server, and
        |  `lookup_game_data` instead of guessing Minecraft ids. `.mcp.json` holds
        |  this computer's token for it: never commit it or copy the token elsewhere.
        |- You can't see the game. Say what to look at in game after a reload
        |  when a change is visual.
