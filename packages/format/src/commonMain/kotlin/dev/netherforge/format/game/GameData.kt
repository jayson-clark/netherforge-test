/**
 * What validation needs to know about one Minecraft version: facts the
 * server has, so the plugin answers them from its live registries.
 *
 * `format` owns this interface and no data. The editor answers it with a
 * [GameDataBundle] from its per-user cache (exported by the dev server);
 * tests use bundles written by hand. Client-only facts (model shapes, font
 * advances) are deliberately not here: the plugin never needs one, and the
 * editor reads them from the bundle or its own import directly.
 *
 * Most facts are "is this id in that registry" ([registry], [has]) or "what's
 * in that tag" ([tag]), asked by the game's own registry names, so a new kind
 * of id costs nothing here. The rest are facts that aren't plain id sets:
 * block properties, collision shapes, a particle's options.
 *
 * Every lookup is by namespaced id (`minecraft:stone`). Callers normalise ids
 * with [GameIds.normalize] first.
