NetherForge is a desktop editor plus the Paper plugin that runs what you make
with it. You build **centities** (composed entities made of block, item and
text displays that animate, can be clicked and run Lua), server-wide Lua
**modules**, **menus**, **dialogs** and **resource packs**. Press
**Start server** and the editor runs a local Paper server with your project
loaded; save a file and it's reloaded in-game within a second, without a
restart.

## Features

- **Your project is a folder of plain files.** One canonical JSON form, Lua in
  `.lua` files, ids that are folder names. Version it with git, review it in
  pull requests, merge two people's work cleanly, and edit it in any editor or
  with a coding agent.
- **Real Minecraft is the preview.** The editor finds or downloads Java,
  downloads Paper for your project's Minecraft version, installs the plugin
  and streams the console. There's no simulator to drift from the game.
- **Hot reload per resource.** Saving a centity, menu or dialog (its JSON or
  its one script) reloads just that resource, and a centity's live instances
  move onto the new definition in place; saving a module restarts it and
  whatever required it. Problems and script errors come back with the file and line.
- **A 3D centity editor**: node tree, inspector, viewport with gizmos, an
  animation timeline, and hitboxes fitted to block models.
- **Lua 5.4, sandboxed**, with an instruction budget per call and `require`
  limited to your modules. Events on the things they're about
  (`this:on("click", ...)`), tasks that wait (`nf.wait`, `dialog:ask`),
  saved data, typed commands, and the world, entities, players and real
  inventories. Completions in the editor, and in VS Code or Neovim through
  generated LuaLS stubs.
- **Deploying is pointing a server at the folder.** Put the plugin jar in
  `plugins/`, set `project:` in its `config.yml`, and `git pull` +
  `/nf reload` to update.
- **macOS, Windows and Linux**, tested equally.
- **No Minecraft assets shipped.** The editor reads textures and models from
  your own Minecraft install; the plugin asks the server.
- **Open source**, Apache-2.0: the editor, the file-format library and the
  plugin.

## Download

Get the latest release from the [releases page](../../releases/latest):

| OS      | Download                                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| macOS   | `NetherForge_<version>_universal.dmg`           |
| Windows | `NetherForge_<version>_x64-setup.exe` or `.msi` |
| Linux   | `.AppImage`, `.deb` or `.rpm`                   |
| Server  | `NetherForge-<version>-paper-<minecraft>.jar`   |

Each release also carries the LuaLS stubs (`nf.lua`, plus `nf-centity.lua`,
`nf-menu.lua` and `nf-dialog.lua` for each kind of script) and the project JSON
Schemas for editing outside the editor.

## Quick start

1. Install the editor and open it.
2. **Create project…**: pick a name, the Minecraft version and an empty
   folder.
3. Add a centity in the sidebar, give its root node a block, and save.
4. **Start server**, accept the Minecraft EULA, and join `localhost` from
   Minecraft (same version).
5. `op` yourself from the editor's console, then `/nf spawn <your centity>`
   in game, or press **Spawn at me**.
6. Change something and save. Watch it update in front of you.

The [getting started guide](docs/guide/index.md) walks through this with a
first script, and [deploying](docs/guide/deploying.md) covers running a
project on a real server.
