/**
 * The project's terrains on Paper (`terrain/<id>.json`, format's
 * [dev.netherforge.format.terrain.CompiledTerrain]): a Bukkit [ChunkGenerator]
 * and [BiomeProvider] per world that ask the published generator by id each
 * time, so hot reload swaps it for the chunks generated afterwards.
 *
 * **Threads.** The server calls a generator from its chunk threads, so
 * [isParallelCapable][ChunkGenerator.isParallelCapable] is true and nothing
 * here touches the main thread's world: a published generator is immutable
 * (format's compiled file, its bound generators' noise only read, the
 * [BlockData] prepared on the main thread when it was published), and the
 * published set is one atomic reference.
 *
 * What a chunk gets is [TerrainGenerator.generate]'s blocks written as chunk
 * data (runs of one block, air left out); a custom block's note block state is
 * written like any, and the runtime's blocks adopt it when the chunk loads.
 * The biomes are the areas' (the project's own from the server's registry,
 * which has them from the start-up datapack), and the game then decorates the
 * chunk with their features. A file's Lua stages run inside [TerrainGenerator.generate],
 * in a Lua state of the generator's for each chunk thread at a time (format's
 * `TerrainScripts`), never the plugin's own.
