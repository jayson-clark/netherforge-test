/**
 * The NetherForge plugin, the same on every Paper version: builds the
 * platform (with this jar's [PaperVersion]), hands it to the runtime, and
 * ticks it. Everything else is the runtime's, reading `config.yml` included.
 *
 * Which project runs: `-Dnetherforge.project=<dir>` when the editor launches a
 * dev server (with the bridge on `-Dnetherforge.bridge.port`), otherwise
 * `project:` in `plugins/NetherForge/config.yml`.
 *
 * **Enabled before the worlds load** (`load: STARTUP`), because the server
 * asks an enabled plugin for a world's generator as it loads the world
 * (`bukkit.yml`'s `worlds.<name>.generator: NetherForge`, answered by
 * [getDefaultWorldGenerator]): that's how a project generator makes the main
 * world. Nothing else of the runtime runs that early: [onEnable] only builds
 * the platform and the runtime, and the runtime is enabled once the server
 * has loaded (`ServerLoadEvent`: every world loaded, every other plugin
 * enabled, Vault and PlaceholderAPI included), where a plugin enabled after
 * the worlds would have started it.
