 * moving the anchor carries every node with it (physics bodies included,
 * which simulate relative to it), and physics then settles the bodies where
 * the centity has just been walked to, before scripts see it and before
 * anything is shown. A script's `tick` handler sees where it is after this
 * tick's step, and has the last word (`teleport`, `stop_pathing`).
 *
 * Searching is bounded: [SearchLimits] caps one search at its range and
 * [dev.netherforge.plugin.pathing.NODE_LIMIT] places, answering the closest
 * place it reached; and the new paths walks look for on their own (following
 * something, a block in the way, a partial path walked to its end) share
 * [TICK_NODES] places a tick, waiting for the next tick past that. A long way
 * is so found in pieces as it's walked, over several ticks, rather than in
 * one tick-stalling search. `move_to` always searches at once, since it says
 * whether there's a way.
 *
 * Walks aren't saved; [Instance.redefine] (a reload) and a teleport drop one
 * without `path_end`, as `stop_pathing` does.
