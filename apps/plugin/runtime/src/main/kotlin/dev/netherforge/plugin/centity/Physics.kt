/**
 * The pass that steps every physics body on one instance, once a tick, after
 * animation and before scripts.
 *
 * Every body is measured against one composition first and only then moved,
 * so they're handed to the solver together: that is what lets two bodies of
 * one centity share momentum. A body's velocity and orientation live on the
 * instance ([Instance.body]) beside its transform, and are rebuilt when the
 * definition is.
 *
 * Bodies simulate relative to the anchor along the world's axes (the frame of
 * [Instance.placed]): the centity's space turned by its yaw. So gravity,
 * velocities, impulses and world blocks need no turning, and a turned centity
 * collides with the world exactly as an unturned one would. What a body runs
 * into, in that frame:
 *
 *  - the world's blocks, by their live collision shapes, asked of the
 *    platform for the region the body can reach this tick, in loaded chunks
 *    only;
 *  - the hitboxes of every centity nearby, each box its own obstacle (a stair
 *    platform is a step to roll over, not a cube). The body's own subtree is
 *    left out (its children move with it), and so are the other bodies of its
 *    own instance, which the solver pairs with it instead. Bodies of another
 *    instance are immovable scenery: momentum is shared only within one.
 *
 * After the step, a node's `collide` handlers hear what its body started
 * touching (a landing, a hit, not resting contact), and `wake` and `sleep`
 * when it changed between moving and settled.
 *
 * Physics writes the node's translation and rotation through the same setters
 * a script uses. The rotation it wrote is remembered; when the node's rotation
 * reads differently next tick, a script or clip set it, and the body's
 * orientation is re-seeded from the pose rather than snapped back.
