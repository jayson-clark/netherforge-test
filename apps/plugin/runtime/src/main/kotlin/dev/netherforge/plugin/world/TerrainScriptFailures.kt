/**
 * What the terrains' scripts failed at. A script fails on the server's chunk threads (format's
 * `TerrainScripts.failed`, called as often as a call fails: the same script fails the same way at the same place
 * every time), and is said on the main thread ([drain]): each different failure of a generator once, a warning in
 * the log and a `terrain.script-failed` problem at the file and line it names, until the generator is published
 * again ([restart]). What failed was the file's own result, so nothing else is needed.
 *
 * A generator keeps at most [MAX_PER_GENERATOR] failures: a script whose message says where it failed fails
 * differently in every chunk, and its first few say what's wrong.
