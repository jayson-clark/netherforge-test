/**
 * NetherForge's profiler: exact time per tick step, per script scope and per
 * function scripts run, measured with the same clock as `/nf scripts`
 * (`System.nanoTime` around every step of the tick and every call into Lua),
 * never sampled.
 *
 * It outlives sessions, so a recording goes on across a full reload. The
 * session feeds it: each tick's steps ([tick]), each scope's own time that
 * tick ([scopes]) and, about once a second ([due]), what every function cost
 * ([calls]). Every [BATCH_TICKS] ticks that becomes a [ProfileSample]: sent
 * on the bridge's `profiler` stream while the editor subscribes
 * ([streaming]), and added to the recording `/nf profile` started, which
 * writes a report when it ends.
 *
 * **When it measures** ([active]): always on a dev server (the editor's), and
 * on a production server only while `/nf profile` records, since it costs a
 * little on every call into a script (see the plugin-runtime skill for how
 * much).
