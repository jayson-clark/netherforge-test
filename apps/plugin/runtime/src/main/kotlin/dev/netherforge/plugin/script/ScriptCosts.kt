/**
 * What each scope's code costs the server, for `/nf scripts`
 * and for warning about a script that's slowing the server down.
 *
 * The prelude's budget frames time every call in (a body, a handler, a
 * timer, a task's resume, a command), each frame its own time less the
 * frames nested in it, and charge it to the frame's scope; [record] takes
 * those totals once a tick and keeps the last [WINDOW] ticks per scope. Work
 * done between ticks (a reload run from the bridge) lands in the next tick.
 *
 * A scope whose average over the last [PerformanceConfig.warnTicks] ticks is
 * above [PerformanceConfig.warnMillis] is reported through [onSlow], at most
 * once per [QUIET_TICKS] per scope. Its first tick (where its body's load
 * lands) is never part of that average: a slow start is a one-off, which
 * `/nf scripts` shows as its max.
