/**
 * The session's side of async work: how a result that arrives off the main
 * thread gets back to it, and to the script that waited.
 *
 * An async API function (`async` in the spec) starts its work and hands back
 * a `CompletionStage`; the generated binding gives it to [await] with the
 * waker the prelude made (the callback, or the running task's). When the
 * stage completes, on whatever thread, the delivery is queued on
 * [Completions], tagged with this session and the scope, and runs in this
 * session's [TickPhase.ASYNC]: the waker is called, as the scope's code, with
 * `value, nil` or `nil, err`. A wait is cancelled (its waker let go of, nothing
 * delivered) when its scope is released, when its task ends (`Task:cancel`,
 * through the `async.cancel` primitive), and when the session stops. The
 * work itself isn't stopped: what it did to the world stands.
 *
 * Services carry on with their own work on [mainThread] the same way: on the
 * main thread in [TickPhase.ASYNC], while this session runs, and never once it
 * has ended.
