/**
 * The MySQL and PostgreSQL servers the owner named in `config.yml`'s
 * `databases:` (`nf.db("network")`), one pool of connections each, shared by
 * every package granted it.
 *
 * **Who may use one.** [problem] is the one check, made when a script asks for
 * the connection ([dev.netherforge.plugin.api.NfImpl.db]): the name must be
 * one the owner set up (and could be read), and the calling package's
 * namespace must be in its `packages:` list. A package's own `requires.db` is
 * checked before that, by the generated binding like every capability.
 *
 * **Lanes.** A handle's work runs on a lane of the workers named for its
 * package and connection, so one package's statements to one connection run
 * in the order they were given (as W2.2's `db:execute` before the next
 * `db:query` promises) and never wait for another package's. The pool, not
 * the lane, bounds how many run at once against the server; a statement waits
 * for a free connection (at most ten seconds) before it fails.
 *
 * **Pools are lazy and never block the main thread:** one is made the first
 * time a handle's work asks for it (Hikari connects in the background), and
 * closed with the plugin.
