/**
 * The project's cutscenes and every one playing.
 *
 * A cutscene is a camera path. Playing one for a player makes a display
 * entity (the camera), puts the player in spectator mode looking through it,
 * and moves it each tick along the path with the display's own teleport
 * interpolation (one tick, so the client draws the movement between the
 * server's ticks). The server moves a spectating player to the entity every
 * tick, so the player's own chunks follow the camera. Spectator mode is what
 * stops them moving and interacting.
 *
 * What the player was (where, their game mode, whether they could fly) is
 * [PlayerState], put back when the cutscene ends **however it ends**: it
 * finishes or is stopped or skipped, the player quits ([playerQuit]), the
 * script that played it unloads ([scopeReleased]), the session ends
 * ([stop]: a reload, the server stopping). A cutscene played over another
 * keeps the first state, so a chain never flashes the world.
 *
 * A cutscene belongs to the scope that played it. A reload of its file
 * leaves the ones playing on the version they started with; the next play
 * uses the new one.
