/**
 * Every scope on the project's Lua state, and what they've registered with
 * Kotlin: timers. Event subscriptions live in the prelude's
 * event core; this side raises events into it ([emit]) and keeps a count of
 * who listens to what ([listening]), so work nobody listens to is skipped.
 *
 * Two kinds of failure, two rules:
 *
 *  - **A script's body failing takes its scope out of service.** Its setup
 *    didn't finish, so it's reported through [onFailure] and the scope is
 *    disabled (its subscriptions, timers and whatever its services hold, its
 *    commands among them, go) until its resource
 *    is reloaded.
 *  - **A handler, timer or command failing is reported** through [onError],
 *    and the script keeps running. A subscription or a repeating timer that
 *    fails [MAX_ERRORS] times in a row is cancelled; a success resets the
 *    count. A command stays registered, and whoever typed it is told.
 *
 * One session's: its Lua state is attached once and closed with it ([detach]).
