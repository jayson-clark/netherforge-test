/**
 * Centities that appear by themselves near players, from the `spawning` block
 * of their `centity.json` (see the format page).
 *
 * It runs in the world's tick phase, on the main thread, and keeps to a
 * budget however many players and centities there are: each player gets a
 * pass every [PASS_INTERVAL] ticks (staggered by player, so they don't all
 * land on one tick), at most [PLAYERS_PER_TICK] passes run in a tick, and a
 * pass looks at [ATTEMPTS] places. A place is a column 24 to 48 blocks from
 * the player in a loaded chunk, searched downward from near the player's own
 * height for somewhere to stand ([findSpot]): block reads are the cost, and
 * they're bounded by `PLAYERS_PER_TICK * ATTEMPTS * SEARCH`.
 *
 * Which centities may appear at a place is each rule's filter (world, height,
 * light, biome, the block stood on) and its cap near this player; one is
 * chosen by weight, then a group of them, each member asked of
 * `nf.on("centity_natural_spawn")` first, which may refuse it or move it.
 * Natural instances are temporary (see [Instance.natural]); a pass over them
 * every [PASS_INTERVAL] ticks removes any with no player within its
 * `despawnDistance`.
 *
 * A service of its own, after [Centities]: it only asks it to spawn, keep and
 * remove, and holds nothing that outlives the session.
