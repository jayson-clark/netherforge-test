/**
 * The worlds a project makes and may take away (`nf.worlds.create`, `copy`,
 * `world:unload`).
 *
 * Any script may find and load any world, but only a **managed** one can be
 * unloaded or deleted: one the project's scripts created, or one named in
 * `netherforge.json`'s `managedWorlds`, and never the server's main world.
 * So a script can't delete the main world, or another plugin's.
 *
 * The worlds scripts created are kept in the store under the project's
 * namespace, so they stay the project's across reloads and restarts; a world
 * deleted through `unload` is forgotten. The store keeps how each was made:
 * the server doesn't remember a plugin's generator, and a world made with a
 * project dimension type isn't loaded while the server lacks the type (the
 * server would make it the overworld's height, and lose what's outside). The worlds themselves are the
 * server's: a module restarting or a project reload leaves them loaded, and
 * scripts find them again by name.
 *
 * A copy's files, and a deleted world's, are the runtime's workers' to deal
 * with, in one lane, so they happen in the order they were asked for; the
 * adapter only says what the file work is. A copy is then loaded on the main
 * thread as this session's next step ([AsyncWork.mainThread]), and its world
 * goes to the script that asked (its callback, or its task) through
 * [AsyncWork]: a script that stops first isn't called, and the world is made
 * and kept anyway. A session that ends first (a full reload) leaves the
 * copy's files in place, unloaded and still the project's: `nf.worlds.load`
 * loads it.
