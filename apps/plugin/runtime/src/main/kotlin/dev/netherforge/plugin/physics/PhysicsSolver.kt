/**
 * Moves every rigid body on one instance for one step, and works out what they
 * ran into, including each other.
 *
 * An impulse solver, not clip-and-slide. Every touch becomes a contact point,
 * and the impulse resolving it acts at that point: a box supported under its
 * middle sits still, and the same box supported under one edge is turned by the
 * very impulse holding it up. Tipping, toppling and rolling aren't rules here;
 * they fall out of applying forces where they land.
 *
 * Bodies are stepped **together**, in one shared set of slices. A contact
 * between two bodies applies equal and opposite impulses, and neither half can
 * be worked out without the other body there to receive it.
 *
 * Contacts are solved by sequential impulses: each corrected in turn, the
 * whole set several times over, with each contact's total impulse accumulated
 * and never allowed to pull. That lets four corners of a box on the ground
 * agree on holding it up instead of fighting, and lets a struck ball pass its
 * momentum down a rack inside one tick.
 *
 * Pure: bodies and numbers in, mutated bodies out. The host gathers obstacles
 * and writes the answers onto nodes.
