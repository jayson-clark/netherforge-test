/**
 * Whether the server must restart to run the project as its files say: what
 * it learns only as it starts (the start-up datapack, [StartupDatapack]) is
 * built again from the files and compared with what it loaded. It lives as
 * long as the plugin, since what the server started with does.
 *
 * The datapack is built from the files alone, never with game data (the
 * adapter's start-up has none), so this loads the project again without it
 * rather than reusing the session's snapshot: an advancement only the game
 * data finds wrong is in the datapack all the same, and comparing against
 * the session's would ask for a restart that changes nothing.
 *
 * When the server refused the project's datapacks the last time and started
 * without them ([dev.netherforge.plugin.platform.DatapackOps.refused]), it's
 * built as the adapter built it then (without them while they're the same), and
 * the refusal is a problem of its own (`runtime.datapack`).
