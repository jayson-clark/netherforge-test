/**
 * The walks `mob:move_to` started, watched once a tick for their end: Paper
 * has no event for a path finishing, so a walk is over when the mob is no
 * longer on a path (reached when it stopped within [PATH_REACH] of its
 * target), or when it's on a path that isn't ours any more (its AI sent it
 * elsewhere). A walk after an entity looks for a new path to wherever the
 * entity is every [REPATH_TICKS] ticks, as vanilla's follow goals do.
 *
 * Walks are runtime state, not saved: one whose mob goes (dies, is removed,
 * its chunk unloads) is forgotten without an event, since its handlers go
 * with it.
