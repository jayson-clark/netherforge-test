/**
 * Makes `nf.http.request`'s requests, off the main thread (it blocks), with
 * OkHttp: HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2, TLS with the platform's trust and hostname
 * checks, keep-alive in a small pool.
 *
 * **The SSRF guard is the client's [Dns].** [CheckedDns] resolves a name once
 * (through [resolve]), judges every address with [AddressGuard], refuses the
 * whole name if any is not allowed, and hands OkHttp exactly the addresses it
 * checked, which it then connects to: there is no second lookup to rebind.
 * OkHttp never calls its `Dns` for an IP in the URL, so [checkLiteral] holds
 * those to the same guard, for the first URL and each redirect's. The client
 * has `Proxy.NO_PROXY` (the owner's proxy environment and properties are
 * never read), no cache, no cookies, no automatic redirects, and no retry of
 * a failed connection (a POST is never sent twice).
 *
 * **Redirects are followed here**, one OkHttp call per hop, so every hop is
 * held to the same rules: [declared] (the host requirement, as the calling
 * package's), the address check, `https` never downgraded to `http`,
 * `Authorization`, `Cookie` and `Proxy-Authorization` dropped when the host
 * changes, at most [HttpConfig.MAX_REDIRECTS] of them, all inside one
 * [HttpConfig.timeoutSeconds]. Every failure is a [WorkFailed], which a script
 * sees as `nil, err`.
 *
 * [close] stops OkHttp's threads and pooled connections: a session that ends
 * must not leave them behind.
