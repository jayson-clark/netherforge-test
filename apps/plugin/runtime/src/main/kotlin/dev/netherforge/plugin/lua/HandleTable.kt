/**
 * Every handle Lua holds, by its key: the integer a script's handle is in Lua.
 * Lua never sees what a handle is made of (a UUID, a node's name), only this
 * key, so a script can't read or forge one; Kotlin finds the [LuaHandle]
 * here. One thing has one key whatever class it is (a zombie's handle is the
 * same entry as a `Mob`, a `Living` or an `Entity`), and its entry holds the
 * most specific class the runtime has said it is.
 *
 * An entry lives while Lua holds a table for it: the prelude's handle cache
 * is weak, and a collected table's key comes back through
 * [LuaHost.sweepHandles], which [release]s it. A key is never used twice, so
 * a stale one finds nothing rather than something else.
