/**
 * The project's resource pack: every pack under `resource_packs/` built into one zip,
 * served, and sent to players.
 *
 * Built with `PackLayout.build` (so the editor's preview and the zip agree on
 * every file), zipped with fixed entry dates so the SHA-1 changes only when
 * the content does, and served from a small HTTP server inside the plugin at
 * `<base>/<sha1>.zip`, or from a URL the server owner configures (they upload
 * `resource-pack.zip`, which the plugin writes beside its state). Players get
 * it as they join and again only when the hash has changed, so a client that
 * already has these bytes skips the download, and a rebuild reaches everyone
 * online without rejoining.
 *
 * Glyph and skin characters come from the compiled packs: a pack with errors
 * keeps the last good build (and its characters) running, as a broken centity
 * keeps its last good definition.
 *
 * It lives as long as the plugin, not a session: the server that serves the
 * zip, what each player's client was sent and said about it, and the last
 * good build are about the players' clients, so a full reload neither sends
 * everyone the same pack again nor loses the build to a pack with errors.
 * Each session's [PackService] rebuilds it and sends it.
