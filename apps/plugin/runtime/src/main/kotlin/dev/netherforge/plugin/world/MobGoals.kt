/**
 * Mobs' goals as scripts see them (`mob:goals()`, `remove_goal`,
 * `clear_goals`), and the goals written in Lua (`mob:add_goal`), which the
 * mob's own AI calls through [GoalCallbacks].
 *
 * A Lua goal belongs to the scope whose code added it, like a subscription:
 * when that scope stops (a reload restarts it, its centity is removed) the
 * goal is taken off its mob, so the AI never calls into a scope that's gone
 * or a Lua state that's been replaced. A callback runs in a budget frame of
 * its own with its scope's budget, like a handler. One that fails (an error,
 * or running past its budget) is reported with its line and its goal taken
 * off the mob: it would fail again every tick otherwise.
 *
 * The AI calls a goal while the server goes through the mob's goals, and
 * changing them then would break its loop. So a change made from inside a
 * callback (a goal that removes itself, a goal failing, a script stopping
 * because of what a callback did) waits until the runtime's next tick, which
 * comes before the mob's next AI tick.
 *
 * Goals aren't saved: a mob that unloads comes back with the game's goals,
 * so its Lua goals are forgotten then, and when it dies or is removed.
