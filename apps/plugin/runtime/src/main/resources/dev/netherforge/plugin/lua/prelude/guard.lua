-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- hooks
--
-- One hook function, `hooks.run`, on every thread a script can run on, serves
-- everything that watches scripts run. Its count event, every `hooks.every`
-- VM instructions, drives the guard below (the budget, the time limit and
-- memory). Other events go to `hooks.listeners[event]`: that's where the
-- debugger's line hook plugs in (prelude/debugger.lua), with `hooks.mask`
-- saying which events it wants ("l", or "" while nothing does; set with
-- `hooks.set_mask`), so it shares this hook rather than replace it. (One more
-- listener isn't a hook event: `error`, which `describe` calls with an
-- uncaught error's message.) Hooks are per thread and a new coroutine starts
-- without one, so every coroutine a script makes is armed (`hooks.arm`)
-- before it can run.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------- guard
--
-- The count hook charges the innermost frame. A frame is opened per call in
-- from the host, so a budget bounds one call in (a script's body, one
-- handler, one timer), never a script's whole life. A nested call in (a spawn
-- whose new centity's script runs inside the spawner's handler) gets its own
-- frame, and what it used is charged to the outer one when it returns: a loop
-- of call-ins can't do more than its own budget's worth of work.
--
-- Instructions aren't the only way to take time: a C function is one
-- instruction however long it runs. The standard library's are capped
-- ("=nf/caps"), and each frame also has a time limit, `deadline_ms` from when
-- it opened (or its outer frame's, if sooner): every `deadline_every` hooks,
-- or sooner when capped functions spend enough work (`guard.spend`), the hook
-- reads the clock.
--
-- Memory: every script shares one Lua state, so past `memory_mb` (checked
-- every `memory_every` hooks, and at the end of every collection cycle) the
-- hook collects fully, and if that wasn't garbage, works out who holds it
-- (`guard.census`). The scope holding the most is blamed, not whichever
-- happened to be running: the host stops it at the end of the tick
-- (`host.take_blamed`), which lets go of what it holds, and if it's the
-- running call's own scope, that call fails there and then.
--
-- Stopping a frame raises a Lua error, which a script could catch with
-- pcall. So the frame remembers why it stopped (`overran`) and the host
-- reports it either way: catching the error doesn't save the script, it
-- only delays the end.
--
-- A frame also knows whose code it runs (`scope`): a handle's `:on` registers
-- into the script that is running, the one whose body, handler or timer
-- called it. (`require` switches it to the module while a file loads.)
