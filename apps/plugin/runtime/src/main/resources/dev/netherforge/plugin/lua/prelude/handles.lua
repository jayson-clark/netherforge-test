-- Handles. A handle is an empty table standing for one key in the runtime's
-- handle table (`ids[handle]`, an integer): Kotlin keeps what the handle is (a
-- UUID, a node's name) and Lua never sees it, so a script can't forge a
-- handle or read what it's made of except through its methods. Kotlin makes
-- the tables (`LuaHost.pushHandle`) and finds a key's table in `cache`, so two
-- handles to the same thing are the same table and compare equal.
--
-- A handle's metatable is its class's, and the runtime may give it a more
-- specific one later (an Entity handed out while its entity was unloaded is
-- the Mob it is once it's back): the same table, with more methods. When Lua
-- lets go of a table, its key goes back to the runtime: `__gc` notes it, and
-- `take_released` hands over those whose key has no table again.
--
-- The typed values (`Vec3`, `Location`) are registered here too, as kinds, so
-- Kotlin can tell what a table is by its genuine metatable (`kinds`): no
-- script can reach those metatables to fake one.
