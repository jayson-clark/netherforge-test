 * where the suites run inside the server (see the testing skill). The suites
 * only say what every [Platform] must do; this says how to drive one.
 *
 * Its platform is bound to [events] (and to [itemLooks] for project items)
 * and has bots, which the suites join as their players. Suites call the
 * platform only inside [main]; between calls they let the server run with
 * [ticks].
