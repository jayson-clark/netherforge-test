/**
 * `nf.schedule` on a real server, in the shipped jar (cron-utils and all): the schedules are made
 * with their next runs ahead, and a cron schedule for every minute runs on the main thread's tick,
 * again and again. The server's wall clock runs 60 times as fast
 * ([RuntimeConfig.WALL_CLOCK_RATE_PROPERTY], test-only), so a minute is a second and the run doesn't
 * wait for the next real minute; what fires it is the real tick. The rules themselves (zones,
 * daylight saving, catching up) are tested against a clock the test moves, in the runtime's
 * `ScheduleTest`.
