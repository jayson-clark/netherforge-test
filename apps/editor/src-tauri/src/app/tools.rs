//! Where the editor finds what it runs, and what it reads outside a project:
//! the plugin jars, the test runner, lua-language-server, Java, Paper and the
//! player's Minecraft installs. Worked out once when the app starts (from its
//! resources and the environment) and kept in `AppState`, so a command never
//! looks anything up for itself, and the contract suite can hand the real
//! commands stand-ins in temp folders (`commands::contract`).
