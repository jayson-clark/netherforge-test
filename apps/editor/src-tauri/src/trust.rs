//! Workspace trust, as VS Code has it: a project opened from a folder the
//! user hasn't trusted opens and edits, but nothing in it runs and nothing
//! acts on it unattended until they say so.
//!
//! **What waits for trust** (each refused here, in the backend, with
//! [crate::error::ErrorCode::Untrusted], never only hidden in the UI):
//!
//! - the dev server (`server_start`): it runs the project's scripts, its
//!   packages' too, on a JVM with the user's files and network;
//! - lua-language-server (`luals_start`): it reads the project's
//!   `.luarc.json`, which can name a Lua plugin for LuaLS to run as the user;
//! - fetching its git packages (`package_fetch_git` past the cache): network
//!   and `git` aimed at URLs the project chose;
//! - agents' MCP tools (`mcp::UiPipe`): an agent driving an editor whose
//!   project nobody vetted could start that server or run its commands.
//!
//! Reading and writing its files, validating it, previews and the explorer
//! need no trust: format only reads data, and the webview never runs a
//! project's Lua.
//!
//! **Where it's kept**: `<config>/trusted.json`, keyed by the canonical
//! project root ([crate::fs::ProjectRoot]), so the same folder reached
//! through a link is the same project, and a project moved or copied
//! elsewhere is untrusted again. A project the user creates in the editor is
//! trusted (they made it). The webview only asks; it never decides.
