/**
 * Blocks as a few big meshes, one per texture, with the faces nobody can see
 * left out: each block state is baked once (`bakeFaces`), and a face with a
 * `cullface` is dropped when the neighbour on that side covers the whole side
 * with an opaque face, as the game does. A solid 48³ cube is then its six
 * outer walls, not 110 592 blocks' worth of quads, which keeps a preview
 * interactive.
 *
 * Shared by the structure preview (one mesh for the whole box) and the
 * map preview (one mesh per chunk, built in a worker, whose
 * neighbours across chunk borders come from the chunks next to it). Where
 * the blocks are is a `BlockSource`; which states hide which sides comes in
 * as numbers. Pure, and free of three.js and the DOM, so it runs in a worker
 * and is tested without textures or WebGL.
