/**
 * The API's LuaLS stubs as this project's lua-language-server reads them:
 * `nf.lua` and `surfaces/*.lua` from `@netherforge/api`, written into
 * `.netherforge/luals/` (`stubs.ts`) with every function the project can't
 * use marked `---@deprecated`, saying why. LuaLS then flags a call to one
 * (its `deprecated` diagnostic) in the editor and in any other editor that
 * reads the project's `.luarc.json`.
 *
 * What a project can't use (`gates.json`, generated from the spec): a
 * function newer than the Minecraft version the project targets (`since`),
 * and one that needs something the project hasn't declared (`requires`,
 * `granted` in `@netherforge/api/requirements`). A function has one
 * definition in `nf.lua`, and LuaLS calls a call deprecated only when every
 * definition is, so the mark goes into the copy itself rather than a file
 * beside it.
