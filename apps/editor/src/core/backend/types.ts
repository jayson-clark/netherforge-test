/**
 * The contract between the editor's UI and its Rust backend.
 *
 * Every Tauri command and event, and every type they carry, is generated
 * from the Rust side by tauri-specta (`generated/bindings.ts`, from
 * `src-tauri/src/commands/bindings.rs`; `pnpm generate` rewrites it). This
 * file re-exports those types and adds what only the UI has: the `Backend`
 * interface (which also covers Tauri's own plugins: dialogs, the updater,
 * menus), its errors and the menu model. The UI never calls `invoke`
 * directly: it goes through a `Backend`, which is `TauriBackend` in the app
 * and `MemoryBackend` in unit and e2e tests; `contract.json` is what both
 * must do.
 *
 * Paths:
 * - "project paths" are relative to the open project root, `/`-separated on
 *   every OS. The backend refuses any that escape the root.
 * - "absolute paths" are only used to open/create a project and to pick a
 *   client jar, and come from a native dialog or the recent list.
