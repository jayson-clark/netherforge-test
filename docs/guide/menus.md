# Menus

A menu is a window you put in front of a player: a shop, a class picker, a warp
menu, a chest with rules. It lives in `menus/<id>/`, as a `menu.json` with its
one script beside it. The [menu format](../format/menu.md) has every key.

```
menus/
  shop/
    menu.json
    script.lua       the menu's script: every click in the window, and each slot's
```

## The window

```json
{
  "$schema": "../../.netherforge/schema/menu.schema.json",
  "name": "Village shop",
  "rows": 3,
  "title": "<dark_gray>Village shop",
  "skin": "ui/shop",
  "slots": {
    "11": {
      "item": {
        "kind": "minecraft:bread",
        "count": 4,
        "name": "<yellow>Bread",
        "lore": ["<gray><glyph:ui/coin> 2"]
      }
    },
    "13": {
      "item": {
        "kind": "minecraft:paper",
        "name": "<red>Ruby",
        "lore": ["<gray><glyph:ui/coin> 50"],
        "itemModel": "ui/ruby"
      }
    },
    "15": { "item": { "kind": "minecraft:barrier", "name": "<red>Close" } }
  },
  "script": { "file": "script.lua" }
}
```

- **`type`**: `chest` (the default, 1–6 `rows` of nine), `barrel`,
  `shulker_box`, `hopper`, `dispenser`, `dropper` or `crafter`. Only
  containers whose every slot is plain storage are offered: a furnace's fuel
  and result slots fight a menu.
- **`title`** is MiniMessage. With no `title` and no `skin`, the window shows
  the menu's `name`.
- **`slots`** are keyed by index: `"0"` is the top left, counting left to
  right, then down. A three-row chest has slots 0–26. A slot is just the item
  that starts in it.

## Shared or per player

By default every player who opens a menu gets **their own** window: one
player's view shouldn't change another's. Set `"shared": true` for **one**
window for the whole server, such as a shop's stock or a community chest.

## Locked or not

By default a menu is **locked**: clicks never move items, and scripts hear
them instead. That's what a shop or a picker wants. Set `"locked": false` for
real storage, where players move items in and out.

## Items

Items are written the same way everywhere in a project (slots, dialog bodies,
particle emitters):

```json
{
  "kind": "minecraft:diamond_sword",
  "name": "<aqua>Frostbite",
  "lore": ["<gray>Cold to the touch"],
  "enchantments": { "minecraft:sharpness": 5 },
  "unbreakable": true,
  "data": { "frost": 3 }
}
```

Besides `kind`, `count`, `name` and `lore`, an item can have a `glint` (the
enchanted shimmer, handy for "selected"), `hideTooltip` (for decorative filler
panes), `damage`, `color` (`#RRGGBB` for leather, potions, maps), `profile`
(whose head, for player heads) and `data`: your scripts' own data, saved on the
stack so it goes wherever the item goes. See [Items](../format/menu.md#items).

## Custom looks

With a [resource pack](resource-packs.md) in the project:

- `"skin": "<pack>/<key>"` draws your own background art behind the window,
  with the title's words written over it where vanilla puts the title;
- an item's `"itemModel": "<pack>/<key>"` gives that one stack a custom
  picture without replacing the vanilla item;
- an item's `"tooltipStyle": "<pack>/<key>"` gives its tooltip a custom frame;
- `<glyph:<pack>/<key>>` in any name, lore line or title puts a small picture
  in the text, like the coin in `"<gray><glyph:ui/coin> 50"`.

A dispenser, dropper or crafter centres its title on the title's words, which
would drag a skin along with them. The server puts the skin back where it
belongs by measuring the words with the default font's advances in
`fonts/default.json`, which the editor writes once Minecraft is imported.
Without that file (or for characters it doesn't cover) the skin moves with the
title's length, and the project shows a `font.needed` warning. A skin with no
title words never moves.

Items can carry more than a name and lore: how many stack (`max_stack_size`),
a `rarity` (the name's colour), `attribute_modifiers` (what wearing or holding
it changes), `can_break` and `can_place_on` (adventure mode), `food` (any item
can be made edible) and a `cooldown` after use:

```json
{
  "kind": "minecraft:paper",
  "name": "<gold>Travel bread",
  "rarity": "rare",
  "maxStackSize": 16,
  "food": { "nutrition": 6, "saturation": 4, "eatSeconds": 0.8 },
  "cooldown": { "seconds": 5, "group": "shop:snacks" },
  "attributeModifiers": [
    {
      "attribute": "minecraft:movement_speed",
      "amount": 0.1,
      "operation": "add_multiplied_total",
      "slot": "off_hand"
    }
  ]
}
```

See [Items](../format/menu.md#items) for every field.

## Opening one

From any script, open a menu for a player by its id:

```lua
nf.commands.register("shop", { players_only = true }, function(event)
  event.player:open_menu("shop")
end)
```

For a per-player menu, `player:open_menu` makes a new window filled
from the file. For a `shared` one, it opens the one window everybody shares,
which you can also reach at any time with `nf.menus.shared("bank")`.
`player:close_menu()` closes the menu they have open.

A new window can be handed anything you like as its `context`: the item being
bought, the centity that was clicked, a callback. Its script reads it with
`this:context()`, and every event on the window carries it as `event.context`.
It's the very value you passed, kept on the server, never a copy:

```lua
-- modules/greeter/init.lua
event.player:open_menu("shop", { context = { nickname = "Lex" } })

-- menus/shop/script.lua
local context = this:context() or {}
this:on("open", function(event)
  if context.nickname then
    event.player:send_message("<gold>Welcome to the shop, " .. nf.text.escape(context.nickname) .. "!")
  end
end)
```

A shared menu has one window for everyone, so opening it with a context is an
error.

## The script

A menu has one script, named by the top-level `script` in `menu.json`. Slots
have none: the script handles every slot, and the window around them. (A long
script can `require` more files beside it, which run as part of it: see
[`require`](scripting.md#require).) In it,
`this` is the window (a [Menu](../reference/menu.md)), and `this:slot(n)` is
one of its slots (a [Slot](../reference/slot.md)):

```lua
-- menus/shop/script.lua
local this = this --[[@as Menu]]

-- The ruby's slot hears its clicks first.
this:slot(13):on("click", function(event)
  event.player:send_message("<red>Rubies are sold out.")
  event:cancel() -- the ruby stays put
  event:stop() -- and the window's handler below doesn't hear it
end)

-- Every other click in the window.
this:on("click", function(event)
  if event.in_menu and event.index == 15 then
    event.player:close_menu()
    event:cancel()
  end
end)
```

The first line tells lua-language-server which `this` it is (see
[External editors](external-editors.md#lua-luals-stubs)). The editor writes
it into every script it creates.

**Every window gets its own copy of the script**, with its own globals,
started when the window is made: when it's opened for someone, or when the
project loads for a `shared` one. So a top-level `local` in a per-player
menu's script is that player's state for as long as the window is open.

The script's body runs when the window is made, before anyone sees it: the
place to fill it in (and again after a reload). Then it listens on the window
and its slots:

| Event   | When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `open`  | Someone opened this window. Then `nf.on("menu_open")` hears it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `click` | Someone clicked while it was open. A slot's `click` handlers hear clicks on it first, then the window's, then (for a window made from a script's `nf.menus.create` template) the template's, then `nf.on("menu_click")`. `event:cancel()` cancels the click; `event:stop()` ends it there. |
| `drag`  | Someone dragged a stack across its slots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `close` | Someone closed it, or left with it open. When the last viewer of a per-player window leaves, the window goes, and its handlers with it.                                                                                                                                                    |

`nf.on("unload", handler)` hears the script stopping: its window went, the
menu reloaded, or the server is stopping. A **locked** window starts every
click that would move items in or out already cancelled; a handler can let one
through with `event:uncancel()`. What a handler returns means nothing.

The click event says who clicked (`player`), where (`index`, and `in_menu`:
`true` in the window, `false` in the player's own inventory below it; `target`
is the window's [Slot](../reference/slot.md), or `nil` below), how (`click`:
`left`, `right`, `shift_left`, `number_key`, …) and what was there (`item`,
`cursor_item`). `hotbar_index` is the hotbar slot for a `number_key` click. See [MenuClickEvent](../reference/events.md#menuclickevent).

Behaviour several menus share (a price list, a "back" button) goes in a
[module](modules.md) that each script requires.

## Changing what's in it

Scripts read and write items as plain tables with the same fields as the
file, in `snake_case` (`item_model`, `tooltip_style`, `hide_tooltip`):

```lua
-- A menu that shows each player their own balance.
this:on("open", function(event)
  local coins = load_coins(event.player) -- your own function
  this:set_item(4, {
    kind = "minecraft:gold_nugget",
    name = "<gold>" .. coins .. " coins",
  })
end)
```

```lua
-- Selling one loaf: read a slot, change it, write it back.
local bread = this:item(11)
if bread and bread.count > 1 then
  bread.count = bread.count - 1
  this:set_item(11, bread)
end
```

```lua
-- Tag what you hand out, and recognise it later wherever it ends up.
this:slot(13):set_item({ kind = "minecraft:gold_nugget", name = "<gold>Coin", data = { coin = true } })

this:on("click", function(event)
  if event.item and event.item.data and event.item.data.coin then
    event.player:send_message("<gold>That's a coin.")
  end
end)
```

Reading an item, changing a field and writing it back keeps everything else
about the stack, including what these fields can't describe: that rides along
in `raw`, which you never write yourself. `data` is your own: an empty
`data = {}` clears the stack's data, and leaving `data` out leaves it alone.
Something a `data()` table couldn't keep in `data` (a function, a `Menu` window) is an error. `add_item` puts
an item wherever it fits, `items()` lists everything by slot, `clear()` empties
every slot (`set_item(index, nil)` empties one), `set_items({ [11] = a, [15] = b })`
writes several at once (all checked before any changes), `fill(item, indices?)`
fills every empty slot (or the listed ones), `slot(index)` hands out one slot
as a handle, `rows()` says how many rows it has, `cursor_item(player)` and
`set_cursor_item(player, item)` read and change what a viewer carries, and
`viewers()` lists who's looking. The [Menu reference](../reference/menu.md)
has the full list, including `set_title`, `set_skin` and `set_locked`.

Changes a script makes are never written into the project: a per-player
window starts from the file every time it's opened, and a shared one starts
from the file when the project loads.
Keep anything that must last (a shop's stock, a bank) in a [saved table](scripting.md#saving-data), like `nf.data("shop")`.

## Menus made in a script

A menu that depends on what's happening (a confirmation, a picker of
whatever's for sale today) can be made in Lua instead of a file.
`nf.menus.create(definition)` takes what `menu.json` would say, in Lua
spelling, and returns a `MenuTemplate`:

```lua
-- modules/reset/init.lua
local confirm = nf.menus.create({
  rows = 1,
  title = "<red>Reset your island?",
  slots = {
    [3] = { kind = "minecraft:lime_wool", name = "<green>Yes" },
    [5] = { kind = "minecraft:red_wool", name = "<red>No" },
  },
})

confirm:on("click", function(event)
  if event.index == 3 then
    event.player:send_message("<green>Done.")
  end
  event.player:close_menu()
end)

nf.commands.register("reset", { players_only = true }, function(event)
  event.player:open_menu(confirm)
end)
```

The definition takes `type`, `rows`, `title`, `skin`, `locked` (true unless
you say otherwise) and `slots`, items by slot number from 0, and is checked by
the same rules as a file: a misspelled key, a slot outside the window, an item
the server doesn't have or a skin your resource packs don't have is an error.

`player:open_menu(template, options?)` opens a new window of it each time,
never shared, with a `context` if you like. A template has no script of its
own: handlers on the template (`open`, `close`, `click`, `drag`) hear every
window made from it, after the window's own handlers and before `nf.on`. A
window knows where it came from (`menu:template()`; its `kind()` is `nil`, as it
has no folder), and `template:windows()` lists the ones open.

A template lasts as long as the script that made it: when that script
unloads, or you call `template:remove()`, its windows close and its handlers
go. See the [MenuTemplate reference](../reference/menutemplate.md).

## Measuring text

`nf.text.width(text)` says how many pixels wide a line of MiniMessage text
draws in the game's font, glyphs included, for lining text up in a title or a
text display:

```lua
local width = nf.text.width("<bold>Shop")
```

The game's font is part of Minecraft itself, which the server doesn't have, so
the editor writes its widths into the project as `fonts/default.json` from the
Minecraft you imported (commit it with the rest). Without that file, or for a
character it doesn't cover, the answer is `nil`.
