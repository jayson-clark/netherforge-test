# What is NetherForge?

NetherForge is a desktop editor, built like a game engine editor, for making
content that runs on a Minecraft server, plus the Paper plugin that runs it.

You work in a **project**: a folder on your machine that holds everything as
plain files.

| In a project       | What it is                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Centities**      | Composed, scripted entities: a tree of block, item and text displays that move, animate and can be clicked. |
| **Modules**        | Server-wide Lua: listen for events, add commands, keep shared state, spawn centities.                       |
| **Menus**          | Windows you open in front of players: shops, pickers, chests with rules.                                    |
| **Dialogs**        | Screens of text, questions and buttons, on Minecraft's dialog screens.                                      |
| **Resource packs** | Your own pictures: menu backgrounds, small glyphs for text, item looks, tooltip frames.                     |

The editor opens a project, shows it (a 3D viewport for centities, a Lua
editor with completions, a problems list), and runs a **local Paper server**
with the NetherForge plugin. When you save, the plugin reloads what changed.
There's no simulator: the real server is the preview.

## How the pieces fit

```
your project (a folder, in git)
   │
   ├── NetherForge editor ──── starts ───▶ local Paper server + NetherForge plugin
   │        │                                     ▲
   │        └──────────── hot reload on save ─────┘
   │
   └── your production server: the same plugin, pointed at a checkout of the project
```

- The **editor** writes the files, validates them, and drives the dev server.
- The **plugin** reads the project folder directly. There's no build step and
  no export: deploying is pointing a server at the folder.
- **Git** is how you version, share and review a project. NetherForge has no
  accounts and no cloud.

## Where to go next

1. [Install the editor](install.md).
2. [Create a project and join its dev server](first-project.md).
3. [Make your first centity](first-centity.md) and [give it a script](first-script.md).

After that, the guides cover each part in depth, the [file format](../format/project.md)
is the full specification of what a project contains, and the
[Lua API reference](../reference/index.md) lists everything scripts can call.
