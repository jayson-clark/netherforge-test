# Migrations

A package keeps data in its own SQLite database (`nf.db()`, see
[`Database`](../reference/database.md)), which the package asks for in its
`netherforge.json` with `"requires": { "db": true }` (see
[Requirements](project.md#requirements)); without it, `nf.db()` is an error
naming the package. A **migration** is one step of that
database's schema: a file `migrations/NNN_name.sql` holding plain SQL, with
nothing beside it.

```sql
-- migrations/001_init.sql
CREATE TABLE scores (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  score INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
-- migrations/002_rank.sql
ALTER TABLE scores ADD COLUMN rank INTEGER;
```

## Names and numbers

A migration is named `NNN_name.sql`: three digits, then lowercase letters,
digits and `_` (the id, `001_init`, follows the usual [id](project.md#ids)
rules). The numbers run `001`, `002`, `003` with none skipped and none used
twice, so the order is never a guess.

| What                                          | Problem               |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| A file that isn't `NNN_name.sql` (`init.sql`) | `migration.name`      |
| Two files with the same number                | `migration.duplicate` |
| A number that doesn't follow the one before   | `migration.gap`       |

The numbers are also the migration's identity in the database, which
records the ones it has had. Add a new file for each change; never reuse a
number.

## Only the package's own database

Migrations build the package's **own** SQLite database. They don't run on a
named MySQL or PostgreSQL connection the server's owner set up (`nf.db("network")`):
a migration is SQLite's dialect, and a shared server's tables may belong to
other packages or tools. A package that keeps tables on a shared connection
creates them itself (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shop_scores (...)` through
`db:execute`, in that server's dialect), or leaves the schema to whoever runs
the server. See [Databases for scripts](../guide/deploying.md#databases-for-scripts).

## What the server does with them

When the project loads (and again when a migration file is added on a reload),
the plugin applies each package's migrations, in number order, to that
package's database: `plugins/NetherForge/databases/<namespace>.db`, a file of
the package's own (a dependency has its own, apart from the project's). Each
migration runs once, in a transaction of its own, and is recorded in the
database's `migrations` table, so a restart applies only the new ones. A
migration is one file but may hold several statements.

Migrations only go forward. Editing a migration the database has already had
changes nothing (the database doesn't run it again), and deleting one doesn't
undo it; the server's log says when a database has had migrations the files no
longer have. To start a development database over, stop the dev server and
delete its file.

If a migration can't be applied (the SQL is wrong, or the files have the
problems above), the package's database is **unavailable**: its scripts'
`nf.db()` calls answer `nil, err` with the reason, and the migration's file
carries a problem, `migration.failed`. Migrations before the failing one stay
applied. Fixing the file and saving it migrates the database again, no restart
needed. The rest of the project keeps running: only the database waits.
