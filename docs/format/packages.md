# Packages

A **package** is a project another project uses. There's nothing else to
it: any project can be one, with the same files, the same editor and the same
rules. A project either **depends** on a package (it uses the package as it
is, read-only, and gets its updates) or **copies** something out of one into
itself (it becomes the project's own, to change as it likes).

Dependencies are found by path, as folders next to the project, or fetched
from git repositories. A package registry comes later, in the place the lock
file already keeps for it.

## Depending on a package

`netherforge.json` names each package the project uses by its namespace, and
says where it is:

```json partial
{
  "namespace": "shop",
  "dependencies": {
    "acme_economy": { "path": "../economy" },
    "acme_quests": { "git": "https://github.com/acme/quests.git", "rev": "v1.2.0" }
  }
}
```

| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `dependencies` | Optional. The packages the project uses, each under its namespace: the name the project's files and scripts use for it (`acme_economy:coin`, `require("acme_economy:api")`). A name is a usable namespace, not the project's own and not a reserved one (`package.name`). Each names exactly one source: `path`, or `git` (`package.source`).                      |
| `…path`        | The package's folder, relative to this project's folder, `/` between its parts: `../economy`, `vendor/economy`. `..` is fine (a package is usually a sibling folder); an absolute path, a drive letter or a backslash isn't (`package.path`). The folder must hold a project (`package.missing`) whose `namespace` is the dependency's name (`package.namespace`). |
| `…git`         | A git repository holding the package at its top: `https://…`, `ssh://…`, `user@host:path` (`git@github.com:acme/quests.git`) or `file://…`. Plain `http://` and `git://` aren't fetched from, since anyone on the way could swap the code (`package.git-url`).                                                                                                     |
| `…rev`         | Optional, with `git`: the branch, tag or full commit to use (`main`, `v1.2.0`); the repository's default branch when absent (`package.git-rev`). The lock pins the commit it resolved to.                                                                                                                                                                          |

A package's own `dependencies` are followed too, each path relative to the
package's folder, so a project uses the whole tree. A package from git can
depend on other git packages but not on a folder by `path`, which isn't there
for whoever fetches it (`package.git-path`). Resolving it gives **one
package per namespace**: two different packages with one namespace anywhere
in the tree are a conflict (`package.conflict`, naming what depends on each),
and packages that depend on each other in a loop are an error
(`package.cycle`). A server runs every package in the tree.

## What a package exports

A package decides what other projects may use of it:

```json partial
{
  "namespace": "acme_economy",
  "exports": {
    "modules": ["api"],
    "items": ["coin"],
    "resource_packs": ["ui"]
  }
}
```

`exports` lists resources by the folder their kind lives in (`modules`,
`items`, `dialogs`, `resource_packs`, `centities`, `menus`, `particles`, `recipes`,
`loot`, `advancements`, `structures`, `worlds`); an exported resource pack exports every skin, glyph, item
model, tooltip and sound in it. Every id must be one the package has
(`package.export-missing`) and every key a kind's folder
(`package.export-kind`). Lists are kept in id order.

Everything else is the package's own. A project that depends on it can name
only what it exports: a reference to anything else of its is an error
(`reference.not-exported`), and so is a `require` of a module it doesn't
export. Inside the package, its own resources are named as any project names
its own, without a namespace.

Scripts follow the same rules at run time: a script names its own package's
things bare and a dependency's exported ones as `namespace:id`, and anything
else is an error naming the package. Names the API hands back are written as
the reading script's package writes them. See
[Names across packages](../reference/packages.md).

## Each package on its own

A package is validated as itself, in its own namespace, against what its own
dependencies export: the project depending on it can't make it valid or
invalid. Its problems show up alongside the project's at **package paths**,
`<namespace>:<path>` (`acme_economy:items/coin/item.json`); a project path
never holds `:`, so the two can't be confused. Scripts' errors in a package
say where they are the same way.

On a server, a package's resources run beside the project's, named as the
project names them: the project's item `ruby` and the package's
`acme_economy:coin`. Each package's resource packs are built into the one resource pack
in the package's own namespace (`assets/acme_economy/…`).

## `netherforge.lock`

Beside `netherforge.json`, the lock says what the dependencies resolved to,
so everyone working on the project, and every bundle built from it, uses the
same packages. Commit it.

```json
{
  "$schema": ".netherforge/schema/lock.schema.json",
  "packages": {
    "acme_economy": {
      "version": "1.4.0",
      "source": {
        "type": "path",
        "path": "../economy"
      },
      "hash": "sha256:9f2c…"
    }
  }
}
```

| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `packages` | Every package in the tree, the dependencies' dependencies included, by namespace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| `source`   | Where it came from, by `type`: `path` with the folder relative to this project's (`path`); `git` with the repository's `url`, the dependency's `rev` (absent for the default branch) and the `commit` it resolved to. `registry` (`url`) is reserved for what comes later, so a lock naming one is out of date. |
| `hash`     | The package's [content hash](#content-hash).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The editor writes the lock whenever the dependencies resolve to something it
doesn't say (a new dependency, a changed package), and so does
`netherforge lock`. While it's missing or out of date, loading the project
warns (`lock.missing`, `lock.stale`), and `netherforge build` refuses to build.

### Packages from git

A git dependency is used at the commit the lock pins for as long as its
`git` and `rev` are what the lock says: a branch moving on changes nothing
until you update (**Update from git** on the package in the editor's
explorer, or `netherforge lock --update`), which resolves every git
dependency's `rev` afresh and rewrites the lock. Change a dependency's `rev`
and it's resolved again the next time the project loads.

The editor and `netherforge` fetch with your own `git` (so your credentials
and SSH keys work as they do for everything else) into the editor's package
cache, shared by every project: `packages/git/` in the editor's data folder.
A package from git is someone else's code, so nothing of its repository runs
or is obeyed while it's fetched: no hook, no `.gitattributes` filter, no
submodule and no link. A package is its commit's regular files; links and
submodules are left out, and a commit with a path that could reach outside
its folder isn't used at all. A dev server never fetches: it runs the commit
the lock pins from the cache, where the editor put it.

Every load hashes the package's files and checks them against the lock: a
package from git that isn't what the lock pins for its commit isn't loaded
(`package.hash`), and the lock isn't rewritten to match. If the lock is
right, its copy in the cache was changed: delete
`packages/git/checkouts/<commit>` and it's fetched again. A repository that
can't be fetched (it's gone, the network is down, the `rev` isn't there) is
`package.git`, with git's own words.

### Content hash

A package's hash covers what the package _is_: its `netherforge.json`,
`fonts/default.json`, and every file of every resource (everything under a
kind's folder that belongs to a resource), but no hidden file, README, agent
notes or lock. Listing those files in path order, one line each, as the hex
SHA-256 of the file's bytes, two spaces and its path (Go's `dirhash` layout):

```
3a7bd3e2360a3d29eea436fcfb7e44c735d117c42d1c1835420b6b9942dd4f1b  items/coin/item.json
…
```

the hash is `sha256:` and the hex SHA-256 of that listing.

## Bundles

`netherforge build` writes a **bundle**: one folder holding the project and
every package it depends on, which a production server runs as it is. A
server outside the editor never resolves a dependency itself: give it a
bundle. A project with dependencies that isn't one is refused
(`runtime.unbundled`); a project without dependencies can still run straight
from its folder.

```
build/shop-1.0.0/
  netherforge-bundle.json
  shop/                 the project: netherforge.json and its resources
  acme_economy/         each package, in a folder named after its namespace
```

```json kind=bundle
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "project": "shop",
  "packages": {
    "acme_economy": { "version": "1.4.0", "hash": "sha256:9f2c…" },
    "shop": { "version": "1.0.0", "hash": "sha256:51e0…" }
  }
}
```

A bundle holds only what the [content hash](#content-hash) covers, and the
hashes it lists, the project's own included, are checked when the server
starts: a package whose files don't hash to its entry isn't run
(`runtime.bundle-hash`). Point the plugin's `project` setting (or
`-Dnetherforge.project`) at the bundle's folder.

## Copying instead

**Copy into project**, on a dependency's resource in the editor's explorer,
brings that resource into the project under an id of its own. Its references
are rewritten so they still name what they named: the package's own things
become `<namespace>:…` (which works where the package exports them), and
references to the copied resource itself name the copy. The copy is the
project's from then on; the dependency stays as it was.

## Templates

The editor's project templates (a minigame, a shop, an RPG mob) are packages
too, kept in the project as a folder, `templates/<namespace>/`, and depended
on by `path` (`"template_shop": { "path": "templates/template_shop" }`). A
package may live inside the project that depends on it: nothing in that
folder is the project's own resource, since resources are found by their kind's
folder at the project's top. See
[Starting from a template](../guide/templates.md).
