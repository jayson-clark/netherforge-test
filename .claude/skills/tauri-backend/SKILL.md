description: How the editor's Rust backend (apps/editor/src-tauri) is organised - modules, the path-scoping rules every file command follows, adding a command end to end (tauri-specta generates the UI's bindings and the commands permission), error codes, the backend contract suite shared with MemoryBackend, the dev server's state machine and bridge, the MCP server for coding agents, the nfasset:// and nfproject:// protocols, glyph advances from the client's fonts, opening the launcher, the updater plugins, and the per-OS quirks already handled. Read before changing anything in apps/editor/src-tauri.

# The Tauri backend

Small and boring on purpose: files, a watcher, one child process, a socket,
and a cache. Anything that understands project _content_ lives in `format`
(through the UI), never here. The contract with the UI is generated from
here: `commands/bindings.rs` lists every command and event, and tauri-specta
writes the UI's typed bindings from it (`apps/editor/src/core/backend/generated/bindings.ts`).

## Where things are

## Path scoping (non-negotiable)

A project path is relative, `/`-separated, with no empty/`.`/`..` segments,
no `\`, no `:` (drive letters, NTFS streams), no segment ending in a dot or
a space (Windows drops them, so `x.` is `x` there) and no name Windows
reserves (`CON`, `PRN`, `AUX`, `NUL`, `COM1`-`COM9`, `LPT1`-`LPT9`, any case,
with or without an extension), on every OS, so a project opens the same
everywhere. `ProjectRoot::resolve` checks that syntax (`scope::segments`), then canonicalizes the deepest _existing_ ancestor of the target
and requires it to be under the canonical root, which catches symlinks that
point out (including dangling ones and a symlinked parent of a new file).

- Never `root.join(user_string)` anywhere else. Versions that become path
  segments (`mc_*`, `nfasset://`) go through `version::is_release` first.
- `.git` and `.netherforge` are matched by `scope::is_named`: Unicode
  lowercase, after dropping trailing dots and spaces, on every OS (macOS and
  Windows volumes are case-insensitive, so `.GIT/hooks` is `.git/hooks`). Windows
  8.3 short names (`GIT~1`) aren't matched; a project folder on a volume with
  them is the user's own risk, and git itself refuses them since 2.24.
- `fs_list` and the watcher hide `.git` (any depth) and the top-level
  `.netherforge/`. Writes, deletes and renames are narrower still
  (`fs::is_writable`): never `.git` (a hook runs on the next commit), and in
  `.netherforge/` only `UI_FOLDERS`: `schema/` (the UI's JSON Schemas), `docs/`
  and `bin/` (what coding agents read and run), `luals/` (the project's
  names for lua-language-server: `---@meta` stubs, data LuaLS parses, never
  runs), and `thumbnails/` (the explorer's cached centity pictures). `MemoryBackend` enforces the same.
  The dev server's folder isn't under the project at all (see the lifecycle
  below), so no file command reaches it.
- Writes are temp file (`.<name>.nftmp-<hex>`) + rename. The watcher and
  `fs_list` ignore those names; keep it that way or saves flicker in the UI.

## JVM arguments

The dev server's extra JVM arguments (Settings → Server) come from the
webview, and a JVM argument can run code (`-javaagent:`, `-agentpath:`,
`-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError=cmd`) or touch files (`-Xlog:...:file=`,
`-XX:HeapDumpPath=`). `settings_set` and `server_start` (the file may be hand
edited) check each against `jvm_args.rs` and refuse one that isn't allowed
with `ErrorCode::JvmArgument`; the settings page shows the message by the
field. Allowed: `-Xmx`/`-Xms`/`-Xmn`/`-Xss` with a size; `-XX:` switches and
numeric options from two fixed lists (GC choice and tuning, heap sizing, OOM
exit, never a path or a command); `-Dname[=value]` for a name of letters,
digits, `_ . -` outside the namespaces that change the JVM, its libraries or
the editor (`java.`, `jdk`, `sun.`, `user.`, `os.`, `netherforge.`, `log4j`...),
with no control characters in the value; and `-server`, `-Xshare:auto|off`,
`-verbose:gc`, `-Xlog:gc`, `-Xlog:gc*`. To allow another flag, add it to the
list there and in `MemoryBackend` (`jvmArgumentProblem`), with a contract
case.

## Workspace trust and the threat model

This is the editor's half of NetherForge's threat model; the server's half
(what a project's scripts can do on a server) is in the plugin-runtime
skill's "Threat model".

**Trusted:** the editor's own binary and what it bundles (the plugin jars,
lua-language-server, `plugin.lua`), the user's config and data folders, what
the editor downloads and checks (Temurin, Paper by SHA-256, the client's
assets from the user's own install), and the user.

**Not trusted:** a project folder and everything in it (anyone can hand you
one: its manifest, scripts, `.luarc.json`, `.mcp.json`, lock, `.gitignore`),
the packages it depends on (folders beside it, git repositories and what
they hold), whatever a dev server sends back over the bridge (the plugin runs
project code), and any local program reaching the MCP port.

**Boundaries, and what each enforces:**

| Boundary                                               | Keeps out                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

**Trust** is VS Code's workspace trust. A project opened from a folder
the user hasn't trusted opens and edits (files, validation, previews, the
explorer: format only reads data), but the backend refuses, with
`ErrorCode::Untrusted`, whatever runs or reaches out on its behalf:
`server_start` and `luals_start` (`AppState::trusted_root`), `package_fetch_git`
past the cache (a pinned checkout already there is read as it is; `git::fetch`
takes the trust answer and checks it only before touching a repository), and
every MCP request (`UiPipe::set_refusal`, kept in step by
`AppState::refresh_agents` on open, close and trust; a request is answered
with JSON-RPC error `-32001` and never reaches the UI's tools). The UI hides
nothing it relies on: the refusal is the backend's.

- **Kept** in `<config>/trusted.json` (`{ projects: [{ root, trustedAt }] }`),
  keyed by the canonical root `ProjectRoot` gives, so a link to a trusted
  folder is trusted and a copy or a move is not. A missing or unreadable file
  trusts nothing.
- `ProjectInfo.trusted` carries the answer on open; `project_trust(trusted)`
  sets it for the open project (and `false` stops its server and LuaLS);
  `project_create` trusts what the user just made. Re-opening the open
  project keeps the answer it has.
- A new command that runs project content, starts a process for it, or
  reaches the network for it takes `state.trusted_root()?` instead of
  `state.root()?`, and gets a contract case that it's refused untrusted.

## Commands, events and their types: tauri-specta

`commands/bindings.rs` is the one list. From it come the invoke handler
(`lib.rs` hands Tauri `builder().invoke_handler()`), the UI's bindings
(`apps/editor/src/core/backend/generated/bindings.ts`: a `commands` object,
an `events` object and every payload type) and the permission that lets
the window call the commands (`permissions/generated/commands.toml`, one
permission named `commands` allowing each one, which
`capabilities/default.json` grants). Both files are committed and
generated by `cargo run --example bindings` (`pnpm generate` runs it); the
generated-file check in `pnpm lint` reruns it with `--out` and fails when
they're stale. `build.rs` is plain `tauri_build::build()`: the permission
file is all it needs to know.

- **specta 2 is a release candidate**, so `specta`/`tauri-specta` are pinned
  with `=` (as tauri-specta asks). Bump them together.
- **Types**: every payload derives `specta::Type` next to `Serialize`, with
  `#[serde(rename_all = "camelCase")]`. u64s are exported as `number`
  (`dangerously_cast_bigints_to_number`: nothing we send nears 2^53). JSON
  the backend passes through without reading (game data, MCP messages) is
  `commands::Json` or a field marked
  `#[specta(type = specta_typescript::Unknown)]`: `unknown` to the UI, which
  types it with format's generated contract. Don't put `serde_json::Value`
  in a command's signature: specta's type for it is recursive and overflows
  the exporter's stack. Don't give a contract type `#[serde(default)]`
  either (it makes every field optional in TypeScript); `settings::load`
  reads a file over the type's defaults instead.
- **Events** are their payload type: `#[derive(Serialize, specta::Type,
tauri_specta::Event)]` with `#[tauri_specta(event_name = "fs://changed")]`,
  listed in `collect_events!`. Emit with `sink.emit(&payload)` (the name comes
  from the type); assert with `RecordingSink::named::<Payload>()`.
- **Errors**: a command rejects with `Error { code, message }`, serialized as
  `{ code, message }` and exported as `CommandError`. `TauriBackend` rethrows
  it as a `BackendError` with the same `code`. Give a new failure the most
  specific `ErrorCode` (`bail!(AlreadyExists, "{to} already exists")`); a
  new code is a variant in `error.rs` and a regenerated binding. The UI
  checks `code`, never the message.
- **Generic runtime**: a command that needs the app takes `AppHandle<R>`
  for `R: Runtime` and is listed as `name::<$runtime>`, so the same list
  builds for the app (`builder()`, Wry) and for the contract suite
  (`mock_builder()`, Tauri's `MockRuntime`). That's why the list is a macro:
  `collect_commands!` can't name an outer generic parameter.

### Packages (`fs/package.rs`)

The packages a project depends on are read-only folders outside it, named by
their location: relative to the project root (`../library`), or
`git:<commit>`, a git package's checkout in the package cache
(`AppDirs::packages`, `<data>/packages`), as format resolves them; the
backend never reads `dependencies` itself (the UI asks format which folders
it needs and which repositories to fetch). `package::open` is the one place a
location becomes a root: `git:` and a full commit (`git::location_dir`) is
`git/checkouts/<commit>/` in the cache (`notFound` until fetched); anything
else is relative, `/`-separated, `..` allowed, no backslash, drive
letter, `:` or empty segment, and the canonical folder must hold a
`netherforge.json`; the result is a `ProjectRoot` of its own, so every path
inside it is scoped exactly like a project's (a link out of the package is
refused). `package_files(location)` lists it as `fs_list` lists a project,
each file with the hex SHA-256 of its bytes (the per-file half of format's
`PackageHash`: the webview hashes format's listing of them);
`package_read_text(location, path)` reads one; `package_copy(location, from,
to)` copies a file or folder into the project (only what the listing sees),
built under a temp name beside the target and renamed into place, never over
anything, the target held to `is_writable`. Failures are `invalidPath` (a location or path that isn't one), `notFound`
(no folder, or no `netherforge.json` in it) and `alreadyExists`; the contract
suite covers them with a package beside its project (`packages` in
`contract.json`, at `../<name>`).

**Git packages (`fs/git.rs`).** `package_fetch_git(url, rev, commit)`
fetches a dependency into the cache and answers the commit: a pinned
`commit` already checked out returns at once (no network, no open project
needed); otherwise the URL's bare repository (`git/db/<16 hex of the URL's
SHA-256>/`, made with an empty template: no hooks) fetches the commit by id
(falling back to the `rev` when the server won't serve ids) or the `rev`
(`HEAD` without one) into a temp ref, keeps it as
`refs/netherforge/commits/<commit>`, and writes the commit's regular files
out of `ls-tree` + `cat-file --batch` into `git/checkouts/<commit>/` (staged
and renamed). It shells out to the user's `git` (credentials, SSH keys and
proxies work as for everything else; npm, pnpm and Go do the same; the CLI's
`apps/cli/src/git.ts` is the same steps, and both must write the same files
or the hash differs). **The threat is the repository**, so nothing of it is
run or obeyed: no checkout (no `.gitattributes` filter or LFS smudge), no
submodules, links skipped, a path with `..`, `.git` (any case), `\` or `:`
refuses the commit, URLs held to https/ssh/file/scp-like (`is_url`, format's
rule, plus `GIT_ALLOW_PROTOCOL`), `rev`s that can't read as options or
refspecs (`is_rev`), `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and stdin closed. Failures:
`invalid` (URL, rev or commit), `network` (git's last line), `notFound` (the
repository lacks the pinned commit), `unavailable` (no git). A dev server
gets the cache as `-Dnetherforge.packages` and only reads checkouts. The
contract suite's `repositories` are real bare repositories on the Rust side
(`$GIT/<name>`, a file URL) and `gitRepos` on the memory backend; a step's
`save` keeps an answer (the commit) for later steps as `$<name>`.

## Adding a command end to end

1. **Logic in a module**, unit-tested with temp dirs. No Tauri types there.
2. **Command** in `commands/<area>.rs`: `#[tauri::command] #[specta::specta]
pub async fn`, returning `crate::error::Result<T>`. Payload types derive
   `specta::Type`. Blocking work goes through `commands::blocking`.
3. **List it** in `commands/bindings.rs` (and an event in `collect_events!`),
   then `pnpm generate`. That's the handler, the binding and the permission.
4. **UI side**: the `Backend` method, `TauriBackend` calling
   `commands.<name>(…)` through `call` (or `done` for a command answering
   nothing), and `MemoryBackend` (see the editor-ui skill).
5. **Contract**: cases in `apps/editor/src/core/backend/contract.json` for
   what both backends must do (results and error codes), and the command's
   mapping in `contract.test.ts`'s `CALLS`. See "The contract suite".

Bridge frames are relayed as text both ways, so a new request, notification
or stream needs no Rust change: declare it in format's `Bridge.kt` and the UI
gets its types from the generated contract. Rust changes only with the
handshake (the hello, `PROTOCOL`, which `protocol.rs` checks against the
recorded session) or the backend's own requests.

## The contract suite

`MemoryBackend` (the UI's tests run on it) is checked against these
commands by one case list, `apps/editor/src/core/backend/contract.json`:
each case is a fresh backend with a small project at `$ROOT` and steps
that call a command by its Rust name with the arguments the UI sends,
expecting a result (matched as a subset, `"$any"` for anything) or an
error code. Two runners:

- `commands/contract.rs` drives the real commands through Tauri's own IPC
  (`tauri::test::get_ipc_response`) on the mock runtime, built with the
  app's real context (`crate::context()`, so the capability and the
  generated permission are checked too) and a real `AppState` over temp
  dirs. Only the window is fake; the invoke handler, argument
  deserialization and the serialized rejection are the app's.
- `contract.test.ts` (vitest) runs the same cases on `MemoryBackend`.

When they disagree, **Rust is the truth**: fix the memory backend. Each case
starts with nothing trusted, as the app does (`trusted: []` on the memory
backend); a case that runs the server trusts the project first
(`project_trust`). Cases
cover what needs no network, Java or game install (files and path rules,
projects, settings, the EULA, a stopped server, the cache, LuaLS
unavailable); the lifecycle with a real server stays in the unix-only tests
and `-- --ignored`.

## The dev server lifecycle

`stopped|crashed → preparing → starting → running → stopping → stopped`;
unexpected exit from `starting`/`running` → `crashed` with the exit code.

- **Preparing**: EULA check (refuse with a clear error; `eula.txt` is only
  written after `server_eula_accept`), plugin jar for the target version,
  Java ≥ 25 (else Temurin into `<data>/jdks/`), Paper (sha256-verified,
  `<data>/paper/paper-<v>-<build>.jar`, falls back to a cached build when
  offline), the server folder (`setup::prepare`: eula.txt, server.properties
  with the port forced and user edits kept, `bukkit.yml`'s
  `worlds.<level-name>.generator: NetherForge` set exactly when the project's
  `netherforge.json` names a `worlds.<level-name>.generator` (`setup::bukkit`,
  through `serde_norway`; only that key is ours, a file the server couldn't
  read is left alone, and the plugin asks for the restart that a change needs:
  see plugin-runtime "Terrains"), the plugin and its bots in `plugins/` (any other NetherForge jar removed),
  `netherforge-project.txt` naming the project), and a port check so
  "address in use" is a sentence, not a crash.
- **The server folder is `AppDirs::server_dir`**: `<data>/servers/<first 8
bytes of sha256(canonical project root), hex>/`, never inside the project.
  The project is untrusted (anyone can hand you one): when the server lived
  in `<project>/.netherforge/server/`, a project could ship its own
  `paper.jar` (with the marker that made the editor keep it) or jars in
  `plugins/`, and Start ran them. Now nothing from the project reaches the
  classpath: Paper runs straight from the cache (`-jar <data>/paper/…`, there
  is no `paper.jar` copy), the plugin comes from the editor's build, and the
  project's path is only `-Dnetherforge.project`, which the plugin reads as
  data. World, logs and the plugin's state (`plugins/NetherForge/`, with
  `nf.files`' `data/`) live in the server folder too. Jars a user put in that
  folder's `plugins/` themselves stay (only other NetherForge jars are
  replaced). `setup::tests::nothing_in_the_project_reaches_the_server` is the
  guard.
- **Launch**: the bridge listens on `127.0.0.1:0` _before_ Java starts; the
  port goes in `-Dnetherforge.bridge.port`, a random token in
  `NETHERFORGE_BRIDGE_TOKEN`. The server folder is the working directory.
  Each output line loses its ANSI escapes (the `strip-ansi-escapes` crate)
  before it's shown; `Done (<digit>` on stdout → `running`.
- **Generations**: every start bumps a counter; readers, the exit monitor and
  bridge callbacks carry theirs and are ignored once stale. `stop` during
  `preparing` just bumps it (the start bails at its next check).
- **Stop**: `stop` on stdin, wait 30 s, then kill. A console `stop` goes the
  same way so it isn't reported as a crash. The app's `RunEvent::Exit` and
  `project_close`/opening another project stop the server; `kill_on_drop`
  is the backstop.
- **When the editor dies without cleaning up** (a crash, a force-quit, a
  `tauri dev` rebuild), none of the above runs and the JVM is orphaned. Two
  things cover it: the plugin stops the server itself once its editor has
  been gone 15 s (see the hot-reload skill), and `server/leftover.rs` stops a
  leftover on the next start. A started server's pid goes in
  `<server folder>/netherforge-server.pid`; a pid only counts as a leftover
  if that process's command line has this project's `-Dnetherforge.project=`
  (pids get reused), and it's asked to stop (SIGTERM, which Paper treats as
  `/stop`) before being killed after 30 s.
- **Bridge**: first frame must be a `hello` request with the token within
  10 s or the socket is closed unanswered. A frame is capped
  (`bridge::MAX_FRAME_BEFORE_HELLO` 16 KiB, `MAX_FRAME` 64 MiB after; the game
  data export is about 7 MB): `FrameReader` never buffers past the cap, and a
  longer frame closes the connection and sends the reason (`frames::too_large`)
  to the console through `BridgeHandler::refused`. The plugin caps what it reads
  from the editor too (16 KiB before the answer, 16 MiB after); a hello of another protocol
  version is answered with the refusal and closed, and the sentence goes to
  the console; a newer accepted connection replaces the old one. The UI's
  frames (`bridge_send`) and the plugin's (`bridge://message`) are relayed as
  text; the UI's JSON-RPC client owns ids and timeouts. The backend's own
  requests (ids `"backend:<n>"`, 5 min) fail immediately when the connection
  drops. On hello, if the cache has no
  `server/game-data.json` for that version, or one whose `schema` isn't
  `cache::GAME_DATA_SCHEMA` (`cache::needs_export`), the backend exports and
  stores it, then emits `mc://cache-changed`. A cache of another schema reads
  as none (`read_game_data` is None, `status().server` false), and an export
  of another schema is refused rather than stored.

## lua-language-server

The editor's Lua features are LuaLS speaking LSP; the backend only runs it
and moves messages (the UI side is in the editor-ui skill).

- **Commands**: `luals_start` (starts it in the open project's root,
  replacing one that runs, and returns `{ generation, plugin }`),
  `luals_send(generation, message)` (one JSON-RPC message, framed onto its
  stdin; refused for another generation), `luals_stop`. Every message it
  writes is `luals://message { generation, message }` (the JSON as a string,
  untouched); exiting on its own is `luals://exit { generation, code }`, a
  stop or a replacement isn't reported. Closing or switching the project
  and `RunEvent::Exit` stop it; `kill_on_drop` is the backstop.
- **The binary**: LuaLS isn't one executable (`bin/lua-language-server` runs
  `bin/main.lua`, which loads `script/`, `meta/`, `locale/`), so it can't be
  an `externalBin`: the whole release folder is a bundle resource,
  `lua-language-server/` (`tauri.bundle.conf.json`, packaging only, like the
  plugin jars). `tools/luals.mjs` fetches the pinned version for an OS,
  checksummed, into `src-tauri/lua-language-server/` (gitignored), which
  debug builds run directly; `tauri dev` runs it first (`--optional`: offline,
  Lua just has no language features). `luals::search_paths` looks in the
  resources, then (debug) that folder. Missing is a sentence, and the UI
  carries on without it.
- **What it writes** goes in the data folder, `<data>/luals/` (`--metapath`
  for its generated std-library stubs, `--logpath`), never the app's own
  folder, which is read-only and signed.
- **The plugin** (`plugin.lua`, `include_str!`'d, written to
  `<data>/luals/plugin.lua` on start and passed to the client as
  `Lua.runtime.plugin`): `ResolveRequire` resolves `require` from a file in
  a resource folder as the server does, beside the resource's script first
  (read from its main file's `script.file`), then falling through to
  `runtime.path` (`modules/`); and `require("library:greetings")`, a
  package's module, to the UI's stub of it under `packages=<folder>`
  (`.netherforge/luals/packages/library/greetings/init.lua`). Its arguments
  are each resource folder and main file (`centities=centity.json`) and that
  `packages=` folder, from the UI (`pluginArgs`). LuaLS asks before
  loading a plugin unless the client says it trusts it, which the editor's
  does. It's in the data folder, not the project, because the webview can't
  write anything that runs.

## The MCP server

`mcp/` serves coding agents at `http://127.0.0.1:<mcpPort>/mcp` (settings
`mcpEnabled`, default on, and `mcpPort`, default 47615, fixed so a project's
`.mcp.json` keeps working). It starts in `setup` and `settings_set` restarts it
when either changes (or retries a port that was taken); a taken port is
`McpStatus.error`, never a startup failure.

- **Rust is only the HTTP pipe.** The MCP server is the official TypeScript
  SDK's `McpServer` in the UI (`src/core/mcp/tools.ts`, tools registered with
  `registerTool` and zod schemas, which the SDK publishes as JSON Schema and
  checks every call against), next to the stores and format. The SDK does
  the whole protocol: initialize and version negotiation, ping, errors.
  `mcp/http.rs` checks the request and frames the body; `UiPipe` emits each
  JSON-RPC message as `mcp://message {message, protocolVersion}` and the
  UI's `BackendTransport` (`src/core/mcp/transport.ts`, the SDK's
  `Transport` interface) answers through `mcp_send`. A request's id is
  swapped for the pipe's own on the way in (agents' ids collide) and
  restored on the way out. No answer in 120 s is a JSON-RPC error, never a
  hang. A new tool needs no Rust change; nothing here knows MCP's methods or
  versions (the transport checks `MCP-Protocol-Version` against the SDK's
  list).
- **Stateless Streamable HTTP**: every message is a `POST` answered with one
  JSON body (202 when the body holds no request); `GET`/`OPTIONS` get 405,
  there are no sessions and no SSE, and what the SDK sends that isn't a
  response (notifications) is dropped. Batches are accepted.
- **A bearer token on every request** (`mcp/token.rs`): 32 random bytes,
  per install, in `<config>/mcp-token` (0600). Missing or wrong is `401`
  with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`, checked before method or body, compared
  in constant time. `McpStatus.token` gives it to the UI, which writes it as
  a header into `.mcp.json` (`core/mcp/config.ts`; created by Settings →
  Agents, brought up to date on every project open; the project template's
  `.gitignore` leaves `.mcp.json` out). Per install, not per run: agents
  read `.mcp.json` when their session starts, so a per-run token would break
  open sessions on every editor restart and rewrite a project file each
  launch. It keeps out other local users and programs that can reach the
  loopback port but not this user's files.
- **Guarded against web pages** too: binds 127.0.0.1, refuses a non-loopback
  `Host` (DNS rebinding) or `Origin`, and any non-JSON body (a cross-site
  "simple" POST).
- **Refused while the open project isn't trusted** (`UiPipe::set_refusal`,
  error `mcp::UNTRUSTED`, -32001): agents would otherwise start its server
  or run its commands unattended. The UI doesn't write `.mcp.json` (which
  carries the token) into an untrusted project either.

## Per-OS quirks already handled

- **Windows**: `rename` over a file another process holds open fails with
  access denied → retried ~1 s (`fs/atomic.rs`). Data goes in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%` (a JDK must not roam). `dunce` strips `\\?\` from
  canonical paths. Child processes get `CREATE_NO_WINDOW`. Custom protocols
  are served as `http://nfasset.localhost/...`.
- **macOS**: FSEvents reports `/private/var/...` for a root opened as
  `/var/...` (the watcher maps both). The filesystem is usually
  case-insensitive: a case-only rename is allowed, and install folders are
  deduplicated by inode (`ATLauncher` = `atlauncher`). `/usr/bin/java` is a
  stub that fails without a JDK; JDK homes are `*.jdk/Contents/Home`.
- **All**: `tauri-build` copies `bundle.resources` even for `cargo build` and
  fails when a glob matches nothing, so the plugin-jar glob lives in
  `tauri.bundle.conf.json`, merged only for packaging
  (`pnpm tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.bundle.conf.json` from `apps/editor/`).

## `nfasset://`

`nfasset://localhost/<version>/<path under client/>` (macOS, Linux) or
`http://nfasset.localhost/<version>/<path>` (Windows). The handler
percent-decodes the whole path first (so `convertFileSrc` output works too),
refuses escapes with 400, serves 404 for missing files, and sends
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` so WebGL can use the textures. Besides the
jar's files, an import writes `index.json` (blockstate/item/font ids) for
pickers.

## `nfproject://`

`nfproject://localhost/<project path>` (macOS, Linux) or
`http://nfproject.localhost/<project path>` (Windows): the open project's
files, for `<img>` (resource pack textures, skins in previews). The handler takes the
project root from `AppState` per request, percent-decodes, refuses hidden
paths (`.git`, `.netherforge/`, except `fs::THUMBNAILS`, the cached pictures
the UI shows as images) with 404, and resolves through
`ProjectRoot::resolve` (400 on escapes). `?v=<n>` is the UI's cache buster
and isn't part of the path. Same CORS/no-cache headers as `nfasset`, so the
UI can read a texture's pixels (a skin's advance needs its alpha).
A package's file is `/:package/<location>/<path>`: the location (`../library`)
one percent-encoded segment (so `..` is never a dot segment the URL would
resolve away), split off the raw path before decoding, opened as every
package command opens one (`package::open`, which wants a `netherforge.json`
there), then resolved inside it like a project path, hidden files refused.
A project path never holds `:`, so the two can't be confused.
Binary writes are `fs_write_bytes` (`bytes` as a JSON number array: textures
are small and it needs no base64 crate), atomic like `fs_write_text`.

## Glyph advances

`format`'s `TextMetrics` needs the default font's advances, which only the
client has. `minecraft/fonts.rs` computes them the game's way: start at
`assets/minecraft/font/default.json`, follow `reference` providers (a
provider whose `filter` asks for an option to be on, `uniform`/`jp`, is
skipped: options default off), first provider to define a character wins;
`space` providers give advances directly; `bitmap` providers cut the PNG
(`<ns>:<path>` under `textures/`) into a grid of `chars` rows (`\0` = empty)
and each glyph's advance is `floor(0.5 + width × height/cellHeight) + 1`,
`width` being the rightmost column with any non-zero alpha, plus one.
`unihex`/`ttf` are skipped (format estimates what's missing). The import
writes `client/glyph-advances.json` (`{ "<code point>": px }`); failures
don't fail the import. `mc_glyph_advances` serves it, computing and storing
it on first use for imports made before it existed. The PNG decoding is the
`png` crate, normalised to 8-bit with real alpha (palettes, tRNS).

## Opening the launcher

`mc_open_launcher` starts the first launcher `launcher::find` sees: vanilla
(`Minecraft.app`; `MinecraftLauncher.exe` under Program Files, else the
Store package via `explorer.exe shell:AppsFolder\…`; `minecraft-launcher` on
PATH, `/opt`, or its flatpak), then Prism. Nothing found is a sentence the UI
shows. It never downloads Minecraft (see game-data).

## Updates

`tauri-plugin-updater` and `tauri-plugin-process` (desktop-only deps) are
registered in `lib.rs`; their permissions (`updater:default`,
`process:allow-restart`) are plugin permissions in the capability, beside
`commands`.
`tauri.conf.json` has `plugins.updater` with the GitHub `latest.json`
endpoint and an empty `pubkey`: that's fine for building and running (the
key is only used to verify a downloaded update), but it must be filled before
the first release; with the signing key set and no pubkey, the release
workflow fails (see the release skill). The UI calls the
plugins' JS API behind `Backend.checkForUpdate`/`installUpdate`.

## Tests

`cargo test --manifest-path apps/editor/src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (no network, temp
dirs; synthetic PNGs and font JSON for glyph advances, fake launcher trees
per OS; the unix-only lifecycle tests drive `/bin/sh` scripts as a fake
server; the contract suite above). `-- --ignored` additionally downloads real Paper, lists the
machine's Javas, and boots a real Paper server (needs network and Java 25).
`pnpm lint` runs `cargo fmt --check` and `clippy --all-targets -D warnings`.
